You might assume that fishermen have pretty boring jobs. They spend hours out at sea, often in solitude, trying their best to pull up piles of cod to supply us all with dinner for the next few weeks. Sure, they have a nice view of the ocean, but not many people would say that being a fisherman is an exciting job. But we‚Äôre here today to prove you wrong, because fisherman Roman Fedortsov has made a hobby out of pulling some of the creepiest looking creatures from out of the ocean. Whether he was looking to find them or not, some of these fish are so strange that it's hard to know what they truly are. Either way, these aquatic creatures are all made up of features that make us want to stay far away from them.

Your other content is great, but none of it has the casual, semi unscripted nature of this show. There's the Vergecast, but that's not video. I hope you can do more casual unscripted stuff like this again.",This was the best thing the Verge has done. Very sad to see it go.,I do like having longer shows. It's nice because I can put it on at work and just have it in the background instead of having to change videos often. I hope the verge does something like this show again,"Disappointed to see this show end. A fun, casual show that gave you something much of the other content on The Verge doesn‚Äôt.",This show came and went fast,The Verge feels like it's changing so much...,Why is this over?!

He didn't fit the profile of a bad criminal whatsoever. Bundy was attractive, well-dressed, charming, well-spoken, and a law student. Even private eyes or investigators couldn‚Äôt understand how this upstanding member of society could orchestrate all his crimes. Even, when he was put on trial a few months later, Bundy still had fans who were rooting for him. Though he did present himself extremely well, make no mistake about it: Ted Bundy was a cold-hearted criminal.

How did a young man with such a promising life ahead of him become one of America's biggest villains?

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-edgar-allan-poe-scott-peeples

The prisoner strapped under a descending pendulum blade. A raven who refuses to leave the narrator‚Äôs chamber. A beating heart buried under the floorboards. Poe‚Äôs macabre and innovative stories of gothic horror have left a timeless mark on literature. But just what is it that makes Edgar Allan Poe one of the greatest American authors? Scott Peeples investigates.

And the greatest fear is fear of the unknown‚Äù,"That picture of Edgar Allan Poe you described in the beginning. Pale skin, sunken eyes.

Well that was a picture taken after a failed overdose. They were taking a picture of him cause they thought he was gonna die and they were gonna use said picture to make paintings of him to remember him by.

He was actually quite a handsome man.",Such a clever animation of a great writer.  I can't help but smile and think that Poe would have approved of the style in which you portrayed him and his work.,Great music choice,"The man is a great *Poe-t* , amiright?

Even though he was just a kid when he first graced the music scene with his presence, Justin Bieber has managed to keep relevant after all these years. He has grown up quite a bit, and it‚Äôs hard to believe that he isn‚Äôt that adorable kid singing ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù anymore. Although he‚Äôs done some crazy things in the last few years, like getting engaged to Hailey Baldwin, he hasn‚Äôt done anything that's made him lose his fanbase completely. Justin still has his ‚ÄúBeliebers‚Äù who support him no matter what he does. Because he got so famous at such a young age, it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that he's raked in quite a bit of money since his YouTube days. Rumor has it that Justin‚Äôs net worth is estimated to be somewhere in the range of $265 million. Curious to know how he's spending all of that hard-earned cash? Watch This Is How Justin Bieber Spends His Millions to find out more!

BZbChKzedEk,Can You Swim in Shade Balls?,"I bought 10,000 shade balls and tried to swim in them. They appear to act like a non-Newtonian fluid: rigid under high shear stress, but they flow like a liquid under low shear.
Get a signed shade ball by supporting Veritasium: https://ve42.co/patreon

Receiving a shade ball:
1. Support Veritasium on any Patreon tier and enter your address https://ve42.co/patreon
2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls
3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiers

My sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.

Huge thanks to:
Jordan Schnabel and Cristian Carretero for filming and swimming and providing lifeguard services.
Raquel Nuno for filming and putting up with me.

Special thanks to Patreon supporters:

France has had the most native players and coaches in the last 4 World Cups‚Ä¶ and their dominance has been on the rise. Players like Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba are the children of immigrants and the product of the French soccer academy system. French- born players have played for Togo, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Argentina, Portugal, and many more.  

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

Sorry about the errors and thanks to all the commenters who helped us improve the video! - Mac & Sam,Funny that France won after this documentary,Higuain was born in France too,what soccer? Football please,"If you are born in France you are not an immigrant, is that so hard to understand?","merci de d√©monter enfin cette blague raciste que l'on entend beaucoup comme quoi l'√©quipe de france serait plut√¥t l'√©quipe africaine. Merci, merci üòä et vive la france üá´üá∑üá´üá∑üá´üá∑","These players were born in France, grew up in France, were trained by the French educational and football system. Their mother tongue is French, and most of them do not master the language of their origin country ... and have a knowledge of their parent's culture which remains approximate.
They know only too well that they owe their success to France, and are proud to defend the colors of their country. Even those who play today under the colors of other countries and possess dual nationality have all one day caressed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplaying for France. They remain a pride for our football training system, and prove every day the competence and quality of our academies.

Each country has its own definition of nationality. In France, it is not blood that defines nationality. Otherwise our compatriots from French overseas departments and territories would not be French.
French nationality is a social pact. We are French if we cherish the French language, and a certain way of life. We are French if we adopt a number of values ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as democracy, human rights, gender equality, and laicity. These values ‚Äã‚Äãare summarized by our national motto: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. You will notice that after the World Cup victory, many players of the French national team have publicly resumed this motto, or declared ""Long live the Republic"" to show their commitment to their country, to celebrate the victory.
Ironically, the player whose attachment to France could be questioned is Lucas Hernandez, who was born in France but grew up in Spain and mastered Spanish better than French. But nobody questions his attachment to France because he corresponds to the inconcient representation of a French man.
I apologize for my approximate English and I specify that I am a Frenchman of Moroccan origin with both nationalities.","What Americans idiots who are obsessed with race don‚Äôt understand is that here in Europe (France or For example Switzerland, where I live) the people doesn‚Äôt refer to their ethnicity first to define their citizenship. In those French banlieues they are a lot of immigrants, living in poor areas but the issue is more a social issue than a race issue. It‚Äôs not like in the us, where blacks live in only black neighborhood, latinos in latinos neighborhood. In the same neighborhood, you can have arabs, blacks, portugese or real frenchmen that lives in those poor hood and the young hang out together, regardless of their origin and identifies themself first as kids of the streets of their city than arab, black, ...

Of course it exists racists dumbass that want to make the debate of being French or Swiss to be an ethnic debate, but it‚Äôs not the general perception of the population.

For me, as a Swiss citizen of African origin, I grew in a place where all sorts of immigrants live and despite my blood origin, I identify myself as Swiss because of my culture, the schools I went to and my mentality. And I don‚Äôt hang out only with Africans, but with all sorts of people which I grew up with and who has the same vision of life as me (for example one of my best friend has a French father and another is sri lankan, my upstairs neighbors are portugese, my brother best friend is albanian, ...)",Please put the second star above the french rooster üí™,"Je Suis mexicain, mais Vive la France mes fr√®res",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55XYp2KD2Y

Between you and the rest of the world lies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ in your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to 1.7 square metres of ground. But besides keeping your organs in, what is its purpose? Emma Bryce takes us into the integumentary system to find out.

WR0nMTr6uOo,The Binomial Distribution: Crash Course Statistics #15,"Today we're going to discuss the Binomial Distribution and a special case of this distribution known as a Bernoulli Distribution. The formulas that define these distributions provide us with shortcuts for calculating the probabilities of all kinds of events that happen in everyday life.They can can also be used to help us look at how probabilities are connected! For instance, knowing the chance of getting a flat tire today is useful, but knowing the likelihood of getting one this year, or in the next five years, may be more useful. And heads up, this episode is going to have a lot more equations than normal, but to sweeten the deal, we added zombies!

If you want to try out some of the math from this video here is a great binomial probability calculator: http://vassarstats.net/textbook/ch5apx.html

WHAT WERE THE ODDS OF THIS GETTING UPLOADED TODAY? I guess I can calculate now.,"For beginners, it would have been more useful to explain how to enter the factorial in so the math is easier to understand. Math needs formulaic examples, not just verbiage.  5C3 gets entered into the calculator as 5!/3!(5-3)! which gives you 120/(6*2) = 10. Now take 10 and multiply it by the rest of the formula to get the 31%. Not everyone will get this if you do not explicitly state it.","Believe it or not, this is what I do all day at work, I calculate the odds that parts fabricate and assembled, with inherent levels of variation (thousandths of an inch) will fit every single time, it's called variation analysis and management.   I really love it, but knowledge of probability spills into financial benefits as well.  Based on past events, current state of a business, you can determine the odds of gaining 20% this year, or the odds of losing money on an investment.  Lots of great opportunities for someone who understands statistics and probability.

Colombia actually did agreed to the construction of the Canal and signed the Herran-Hay treaty, but it was rejected by the colombian Senate because it gave the US sovereignty over the land for 99 years. The Hay-Bunau Varilla treaty (that no panamanian signed) later gave the land away literally for eternity. However, several national movements (mostly lead by students) pushed for Panam√° to reclaim sovereignty of our country. In 1964 a group of students marched into Balboa High School in the Panama Canal Zone to enforce an agreement that the Panama flag should wave in all schools. They were beaten by US citizens and the Panama flag they were carrying was torn to pieces. This led to a national revolt. The US army quelled the revolt by deploying tanks and killing dissenters. This prompted the president to formally break diplomatic relations with the US (a first for any latin american nation with US occupation).

This generated a huge momentum, and finally in 1977 the Torrijos-Carter treaty was signed and the transition back to Panama began. The whole process ended in December 1999, and since then the Canal has been operated solely by panamanians.","As a Panamanian this history has a lot a plot holes, don't let this distract you from the fact French started the canal and the USA continued",Actually U.S bought the unfinished canal from French. Which had already started to build it and BOUGHT the land from Columbia in 1880.,"Has anyone ever heard of the ""Fallacy of Oversimplification?""  It's just that I'm taking a class on persuasion and some of these videos are getting a little way out there.  I liked them better when they were just about diamonds and stuff like that.

2u-djVesZW8,The Only Human Ever Struck by a Meteorite Was Affected in Ways That Are Still Troubling Scientists,"----------------------------------------------------------
As far as we have come in space exploration, we have barely scratched the surface. We have been to the moon, we have satellites in space to let is get a look at other planets, but we still don't understand a lot about what is out there. We continue to try to learn what we can, but we may never know all that there is to know. 

It is very uncommon for a meteoroid to reach Earth. In most cases, they burn up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere. If one does make it to Earth, the results can be catastrophic. Past collisions have made it to the Earth has caused huge craters in the ground. It is also believed that it was a meteoroid that killed the dinosaurs. In 1954, a meteorite made it to Earth and did something incredibly bizarre. 

In 1954, most of the United States was focused on Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, which resulted in segregation in schools being outlawed. In the small town of Sylacauga, Alabama had something more incredible on their minds. 

On an afternoon in autumn, residents of Sylacauga spotted something in the sky that looked like a Roman candle. It had smoke trailing behind it. Many people believed that what they were seeing was a Cold War weapon set off by the Soviets. The space rock made its way into the Earth's atmosphere and came down right by a farmhouse in Alabama. When it landed, it landed hard. 

Earlier that afternoon, a 32-year-old woman named Ann Hodges laid down on the couch to take a quick nap before her husband got home from work. Rather than her being awoken by him coming in the door, she was awakened with a violent thud. When she woke up, she didn't know what happened. All she know was that she had a football-sized injury on her left side. She tried to get off the couch so that she find out if she was in danger. What was strange was that Ann's living room was in perfect except for her radio that was on its side, with a massive crack in the side and the pieces were falling out. 

When the neighbors heard the blast, they ran to Ann's house to check on her. They helped her off the couch and called the police. When they arrived, they found a gaping hole in the ceiling, and a large meteorite stuck in the ceiling. The rock hit the roof of the house, ricocheted off the radio, and hit Ann while she was sleeping. A geologist was called to the scene, and he was shocked. No person in history had ever been hit by a meteorite. The only human ever struck by a meteorite was affected in ways that are still troubling scientists. 

When Ann's husband Eugene got home from work, he panicked when he saw the crowd and the police in front of his house. He couldn't believe that his wife had been hit with a meteorite. This was something that didn't happen every day. According to astronomer Mike Reynolds, you have a better chance of getting by a tornado, a bolt of lightning, and a hurricane all at the same time than you do of getting hit by a meteorite. 

Ann and Eugene thought that they could make a fortune off the space rock; however, legal complications could have prevented that. They didn't own the land where the meteorite crashed; they were renting the house. Their landlady sued them for possession of the rock because it landed on her property. Rather than fighting it out in court, the couple paid her $500, which was a lot of money for an Alabama working-class couple. They were sure that it would sell for a lot, so they thought that it was worth it. 

The Smithsonian offered to buy the meteorite from Ann and Eugene. They didn't offer them millions, so they decided to hold out for a buyer who would. They sat by the phone waiting, but the call never came. The media wouldn't lave the couple alone, and they were in trouble financially. All of the stress caused Ann to have a nervous breakdown. She was never the same, and always felt weak. In 1964, Eugene couldn't take it anymore, and he left his wife. 

Ann had no children to care for her, so she went to a nursing home. For the next 8-years, her condition worsened. She died at 52-years-old of kidney failure. Shortly before she died, she donated the meteorite to the Alabama Museum of Natural History. In the end, the meteoroid didn't make her rich; it just ruined her life.

r9sErSlpPPc,The 10 Strongest Animals In The World That Were Totally Unexpected,"The most powerful and strongest animals in the world can sometimes look like the most innocent so you never know what to expect in fights. On earth, the animal kingdom is so diverse and full of different creatures with varying abilities and capabilities that you don't know what to expect. Sometimes, we can pinpoint a worrisome animal just by looking at it. But, not in this case.

10 Unbelievable Animals Created With Science!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wga0OR03jvM

We can usually tell by size, sharp teeth, claws, muscular structure, and other obvious features as to whether an animal could pose a threat to us. When we look at less-threatening animals, they are usually adorable and look as though they couldn‚Äôt harm a fly. But, there are also animals out there who look harmless, but once you turn your back, they will strike. 

There are several unseemingly demure animals which look like they would welcome human contact or converse with fellow wildlife. But like a person with two different identities, these animals are much more powerful than what one could ever imagine. Unfortunately, the only way we learn about these volatile habits is through experience.

This means that someone might have got injured in order to learn about these animals the hard way. With the innovations of technology today, we can better observe these animals in their natural habitat and avoid the dangers of human contact. In this video, we‚Äôre going to talk about the ten most unexpected powerful animals in the world. Many of these animals you can see in your local zoo, and in fact, some contact is encourage. 

Granted, domesticated versions of these animals are not the same as these animals in the wild. But even dealing with these animals who have experience with human contact is a risk because you can never know when that wild side will be let out. 

So, before you go out and start cuddling random animals in the wild, know that they might turn around and give you a nice bite or even worse. At the end of the day, the phrase, ‚ÄúLooks can be deceiving‚Äù is definitely true!

In case you missed it, you can watch the rest of Vox Skate Week here: http://bit.ly/2oGrA7N

2018 Olympic medalist Adam Rippon, and music designer Hugo Chouinard helps explain how figure skaters pick their music. 

The 1932 Winter Olympics was the first time figure skating was performed to music. Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there‚Äôs a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it‚Äôs great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. 

But this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from ‚Äî some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon. Will this be a new era of figure skating?

--

Flannery O‚ÄôConnor scribbled tales of outcasts, intruders and misfits staged in the world she knew best: the American South. She was a master of the grotesque, but her work pushed beyond the purely ridiculous and frightening to reveal the variety and nuance of human character. Iseult Gillespie explores how O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs endlessly surprising fictional worlds continue to draw readers decades later.

She was one of my favorites from my young days. I liked her darkness, harshness and loneliness. This should give me more motivation to write ;)",Books should be depicted in a way that they don't bind your imagination.....usually movies spoils books but Ted-Ed present them in way that their videos enhance our imagination....Hats off guys,"""...*though* she was a devout Catholic""...! How about BECAUSE she was a devout Catholic? The center of her life was her faith. All of her stories are God-haunted. She would read Aquinas before going to bed at night and called herself a hillbilly-Thomist. She called the Incarnation and the Resurrection the ""true laws of the physical."" If you understand this, or at least keep it in mind, you can better understand her work...",Reading is always a good idea! Especially in the winter time!,"*_Ted-Ed's animation seemed like it's improving each video after many years. Thanks Ted-Ed animators, very cool._*","A video on why you should read Antoine de Saint Exupery's The Little Prince with the same people who animated ""why you should read Macbeth"" would be glorious.",I like the animations of your videos.

When you fall asleep in a couch and magically wakes up in bed
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)",This guys say ppl don't know how most  this stuff happens when we absolutely know how most of it happens,hey..we have a magnetic hill too in the philippines :),My wife has magnetic hands once she raises her hands my money come to her.,The rocks move by themselves because of a frozen layer on the ground  that forms at night,"I like how the channel is called Facts Verse, yet the very first area you discuss, you completely omit facts. Your comments on this are completely untrue.


First of all, it is not caused by magnets/magnetism. It is simply a slight decline downwards that appears as an upwards incline because of its surrounding area. It is only an optical illusion.
Also, these are not the only two places in the world that exhibit this phenomenon. There are many more, and they are often referred to as ""gravity hills"". 
To say that we ""don't know why"", when  there are clear scientific reasons for this phenomenon, is just ignorant.

So I continued to watch, and even the next two videos so far have been blatant bullshit.

The first one is simply the ocean tides eroding the rocks. How is that even remotely a mystery?


The second one, to say that scientists don't know why it's daylight... they do. It's because it's in the Arctic Circle. The exact same reason that this happens in Alaska. 


You should change the name of your channel to, ""Dumb shit I thought up because I'm too lazy to do any actual research.""",Well... In finland the sun dosen't set in summer so there is 24\7 sunlight and in winter 24\7 darkness,2:25 they did find a reason (Mystery of Death Valley's Moving Stones Solved Wall Street Journal),Science answered many of those questions years ago.

Thirty years ago when I started exposing the Great Lie, most people ridiculed me, and others like me, saying we were conspiracy nutters. That never deturbed me because I knew I was sharing good solid facts and evidence to support my argument. I also, knew most people are blindly led sheep who could be easily fooled into believing a lie founded on emotional national pride and patriotism. And I also knew there were State sponsored actors who were getting paid big (Taxpayer) money to keep promoting and spreading the false narrative. Gladly, most people have woken up, but sadly the Deep State is still alive and well.",It's one small step for man One giant leap for mankind Happy 50th Anniversary to Apollo 11 and Astronaut was originally going to be my dream job and career,Happy 50th Anniversary To You !

We definitely need more people to see this!

As someone with a background in biomedical engineering and genetic modification, who currently works as a software engineer and has 15 years of tech experience, it seems to me that technology and medicine are two fields where the belief in misinformation (and disinformation) runs rampant through the public. I could be overestimating the proportion of people who believe it, but... there's a movement that thinks vaccines cause autism and death, there's a movement that thinks GMOs will poison / kill / mutate anyone who eats them, and we all know AI will inevitably try to kill us and self-driving cars are more accident-prone than humans, right? (*Cough* that was sarcasm, it's false *cough* ) And the number of times I've seen people cite sources which are flagrantly inaccurate, or worse, which intentionally add citations and totally misrepresent what those citations even say in the first place... I swear, if I have to see someone quote or cite Serralini one more time, I'm going to punch their face. Gently, of course, but hard enough to get the point across.

R2fqp0y9AEs,10 Incredible Mansions Nobody Wants To Buy,"These awesome mansions are impossible to sell! Subscribe for more amazing videos! ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest ‚óÑ

Despite popular belief, a mansion is not always more valuable if it was owned by a famous person. In fact, this ownership can actually decrease the property‚Äôs value. Studies show that the house of a famous person lasts an average of 36 days longer on the market than that of a non-famous person. The reasons for this are paradoxical. It seems that the exact reasons why someone would want to buy a famous mansion are exactly what turn people off from owning said mansion: there‚Äôs too much baggage. Not only is a celebrity mansion already in the spotlight, with many people knowing its history and address, it‚Äôs usually decked out with so many personalized amenities that the place becomes an eyesore. While fans may appreciate these additives, few fans are rich enough to actually buy their favorite celebrities‚Äô shrine. Rich businessmen don‚Äôt care about the celebrities who owned the home, only the home itself. Of course, with celebrities being celebrities, they will list their homes in accordance with their popularity. Now that we know this doesn‚Äôt always help, there are many owners stuck in real estate stalemates. Perhaps they will adjust to the market...if the market doesn‚Äôt already adjust to them.

       One day my dad was going somewhere and he saw a kitten in the dump.
So he went over and picked it up. He put it in the car and went to the vet.
My cat,Gwen had passed away on May,21st,2017. Gwen was 16 years old and was a boy.
I needed a new cat. So when my dad was on his way to the vet he called my mom saying ""I found a cat in the dump
I am on my way to the vet and the cat is meowing like crazy."",I was so excited to see what the cat looked like. I remembered 
that I said,""If the cat is a boy I will name it Max and if it is a girl I will name it Kate."",My dad made it home and I saw a box with holes in it.
My mom opened it and there was a small,adorable,cat. My dad said ""It is a girl."",I asked""Can we keep it?"",He unfortunately said""YES!""
Kate is well and is cute as she was as a kitten.
I was happy",üòçüòçüòçüòç that's a good kitty but why would they let the cat leaveüò•üò•üò•üò•üò≠üò≠üò≠,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0uRTN69rI0

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

In 1917, American health officials launched a campaign to use noxious, often toxic chemicals to delouse immigrants seeking to enter at the US-Mexico border. The same practice had caused a fire in an El Paso jail the year before and killed 27 people.

17-year-old Ju√°rez maid Carmelita Torres refused to go through it, sparking a protest of thousands of Mexicans at the El Paso border. Although they briefly shut down the border, the campaign would continue for decades -- and go on to inspire Nazi scientists.

Yl_K2Ata6XY,Is Our Food Becoming Less Nutritious?,"The nutrient content of food is declining. Is it because of soil depletion, selective breeding, or... something else?
Watch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vita

I came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.

With Food",4:16 I'm starting to think that all documentaries from that time period were voiced by the same guy.,"You missed a perfect opportunity to say ""Now that's some food for thought"" at the end of the video.",has there ever been a reverse study to the one done in japan? i.e. growing crops in a low CO2 density to see if the nutritional values became more concentrated?,"Maybe if we start calling it ""food change"" instead of ""climate change"" more people would worry?",sooo... it's global warnings fault that im fat... I will use this now,"Dude... did you just skip over soil depletion and fertilization by saying 'they still grow big, so can't be a problem?!?!'   - The difference between looking after soil using compost, fallow crops and charcoal vs. modern chemical fertilizers is a massive deal, how could you just skip that?  In a nutshell, there is supposed to be a healthy living ecosystem in soil and its also supposed to have trace amounts of almost all elements in it. Over time plants absorb these trace minerals and then we eat them and absorb them. However, if we don't use proper soil maintenance techniques, and instead we use modern fertilizers, then for the most part we are only replacing the nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium in the soil. These are essential ingredients for plant growth, and allow plants to grow big. However, over time, by never replacing the other minerals and elements in the soil, the soil becomes depleted. This is why we need mineral supplements and multivitamins today - because we no longer get them in our food. Thus, you have neglected a major factor in plant nutrition without even acknowledging it properly.     That said, genetic manipulation, artificial fertilizers and increased CO2 do all contribute to larger plants with lower nutrient concentrations, so thank you for pointing that out. However, do please inform people about the great importance of healthy topsoil. Its been a huge part of our history, as cultures who don't respect topsoil usually suffer the consequences. Check out ""Topsoil and Civilization. By Tom Dale and Vernon Gill Carter."" for more info.",Mushrooms do produce a lot of proteins. So fungi and fermented food might be an adequate solution to get the necessary nutrition supplements in the future.,I was talking to this guy whose wife is a Soil and crop nutritionist expert who studies a lot on the nutritional value of our crops. He was very passionate about the subject like his wife. He told me that his wife showed him all the data about the nutritional value from crops and he was shocked to see how much nutritional value has decreased. People have always mentioned about this topic to me and I have read up on certain studies. I'm glad you're talking about it in a video Veritasium :D,"First sentence: topic introduction

KjI2G9bSsaQ,"Behind the scenes of 'The Handmaid's Tale' season 2 with cast, author Margaret Atwood","""Nightline"" was given rare behind-the-scenes access, where our cameras had somewhat free range to examine the details of the handmaid's world.",2018-05-05T09:01:58.000Z,693219.0,5707.0,200.0,782,"Haha, impossible to binge-watch, my ass. Watched it in literally a single day. What can I say, it's‚Äã an amazing story!","This is both the hardest and best show to watch on TV! Sorry Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, The Walking Dead.. but The Handmaid's tale is the best thing to ever happen to TV!","The most depressing and addictive thing I‚Äôve ever watched, I was in shock for weeks after finishing season 1.",This isn't just a good series but a warning of what could be.,"The first season I binged, but the second one I really can't, I was traumatised for 2 days","""Borrowed from the taliban""... Does the narrator realise the whole premise of the show is based on the biblical Rachael and her handmaid Bilah??","I'm a savage. I binge watched the entire thing in two days, and now the wait is going to be the actual hard thing to do.","Boo you didn't interview Max Mikghella!! His character Nick, especially in the second season, is the only thing that makes all the horror bearable. His arc and performance with Lizzie is awesome.","The handmaid: inspired by the Lebensborn in Belgium, France, Sweden and Germany. Women that looked arian were paired with Nazi-soldiers to conceive a child that was then given to be raised by families from the Nazi-elite. Agnetha from ABBA is a Lebensborn baby. Of[name]: inspired by last names like f.e. Johnson (John his son), Fitzgerald (son of Gerald) and by the fact that many women in the USA still take their husbands name. This act stems from Western tradition where marriage is seen as a transaction. The future husband asks the father to marry his daughter and the daughter takes his name to symbolize she is no longer a member of her own family, but now her husbands possession. Shredders: inspired by the fact that many European cultures killed their unwanted babies. This happend mostly around the mediterranean. Sparta being the most famous example. Genital mutilation: Happens nowadays mostly in muslim countries in Asia and Africa, but scientists traced its origins back around the mediterranean sea. Europeans did this to native Americans and they also sterilized and castrate these poor women in hopes their tribes would become extinct. Child marriages: every fucking noble family in Europe did this. Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII gave birth at the age of 13. She was so traumatized by the event that she never wanted to be pregnant again. Worst of all, even though it is illegal in the West, it still happens every day. Death sentence for adultery: is still happening in the Middle-East and Africa, but used to be practiced in Europe aswel. Most famous examples: Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. Forbidden to own money: inspired by the fact there was a time when banks wanted to dictate how women spent what money they did earn. In the 1970s, single or divorced females applying for a credit card were often required to bring in a male to co-sign their application. Forbidden to own property: women were unable to own any property through most of our history. This was still the case in China until 1911. No control over their own bodies: Many Western countries still do not allow abortions or are trying to reverse the law back to making it illegal. There was also a time that women were forbidden to take birth control. All of this because God is the only one who gets to decide which baby lives or dies. Serena secretly smoking a cig: women were forbidden to smoke until the 1920s. Lack of hobbies: it was, and in some countries still is, forbidden for women to play/watch sports and to play/watch theatre. Just like Serena, women were only allowed to do certain types of activities like knitting and sewing. Reading: forbidden in a lot of cultures, Europe being one of them. When women finally got their hands on books they also started to write novels themselves but their work was hidden, destroyed or mocked by male contemporaries and some women were even locked away in asylums when they wrote fantasy stories because they were 'too weird'. Multiple women in one household: inspired py polyamory, still practiced in the US today. And in Babylon, men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery. Gender traitors: inspired by the fact that the LGTB+ community is still being harrassed and prosecuted in many countries, USA included. Forced prostitution: still happening all over the world. Public punishment: hanging, whipping, stoning, outlawing,... is or has been legal at one point in most countries. England abolished public whipping of women in 1817. The colonies: Russia, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, Belgium, Germany and many other countries did this to their own people or people they conquered. They Eyes: there are very few countries who didn't have a secret police at one point in their history. Education: girls in Belgium weren't allowed to get an education until 1847. France followed in 1850 but the girls were only allowed to have teachers who were members of the church. The Bible as a guideline for family life: inspired by the Puritans in the USA and UK; Based on Biblical portrayals of Adam and Eve, Puritans believed that marriage was rooted in procreation, love, and, most importantly, salvation. Husbands were the spiritual heads of the household, while women were to demonstrate religious piety and obedience under male authority. Furthermore, marriage represented not only the relationship between husband and wife, but also the relationship between spouses and God. Puritan husbands commanded authority through family direction and prayer. The female relationship to her husband and to God was marked by submissiveness and humility. Puritans viewed the relationship between master and servant similarly to that of parent and child. Just as parents were expected to uphold Puritan religious values in the home, masters assumed the parental responsibility of housing and educating young servants. Older servants also dwelt with masters and were cared for in the event of illness or injury. African-American and Indian servants were likely excluded from such benefits. Also inspired by the Mormons; they have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside opposite-sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage. All sexual activity outside marriage is considered a serious sin, with marriage recognized as only between a man and a woman. Same-sex marriages are not performed or supported by the LDS Church. Church members are encouraged to marry and have children. Mormons are opposed to abortion, except when the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy. Many practicing adult Mormons wear religious undergarments that remind them of covenants and encourage them to dress modestly. Latter-day Saints are counseled not to partake of any form of media that is obscene or pornographic in any way. The uniforms: nuns, mormons, puritans, muslims, etc all introduced a dresscode for men and women at some point in their history. In 1890 it was decided in the UK that women must cover their whole bodies in public. necklines were raised to just below the chin, and hemlines dropped to below the ankle. Diagrams were released to clarify what length of skirt was suitable for what age. color coding outfits was also done in regions like Europe and Asia. People who were wearing the wrong color were often sentenced to death. Obsession with fertility and having babies: Christian fanatics urge families to have children to 'defeat the muslims'. The Chinese government wanted more children for their industry and Nazi Germany wanted more babies to stabilize their rule. Being punished for having your period: menstruating women are or were considered unclean on a spiritual level in some places of the world. In some parts of Asia women are forced to sleep outside in the cold during their period. In other countries women aren't allowed to take a bath. The surveillance of the a woman's cycle was also practiced among the nobility in Europe. And so on, and so on. - from Naomi Bousson on YouTube. 

When it debuted in 1985, Atwood even took newspaper clips to her interviews about the book to show her plot points‚Äô real-life antecedents. The book mirrored the United States‚Äô embrace of conservatism, as evidenced by the election of Ronald Reagan as president, as well as the increasing power of the Christian right and its powerful lobbying organisations the Moral Majority, Focus on the Family and the Christian Coalition ‚Äì not to mention the rise of televangelism. The character of Serena Joy in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale is a former televangelist who articulates theocratic policy suggestions that have now forced her, like all women, into a life solely at home: Atwood writes of Serena Joy, ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt make speeches anymore. She has become speechless. She stays in her home, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to agree with her. How furious she must be, now that she‚Äôs been taken at her word.‚Äù ¬† (BBC.com, Culture writer  Armstrong)","This show is upsetting..heavy..emotional..angry..frightening...scary...disgusting...etc etc etc...theres,so much to talk about..the actors,are brilliant...impossible to binge",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjI2G9bSsaQ

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-fahrenheit-451-iseult-gillespie

Ray Bradbury‚Äôs novel imagines a world where books are banned- and possessing, let alone reading them, is forbidden.The protagonist, Montag, is a fireman responsible for destroying what remains. The story raises the question: how can you preserve your mind in a society where free will, self-expression and curiosity are under fire? Iseult Gillespie examines what makes the dystopian novel a classic. 

Lesson by Iseult Gillespie, directed by Anton Bogaty.

2019: alexa play sicko mode","Jokes on you

*I‚Äôve already read it.*",Fun fact. Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451 at a rented out typewriter at the library. So not only could he not go back and edit his writing (can‚Äôt erase on old typewriters) he was hurried because he was being charged by the hour to use the typewriter and he was nearly broke at the time.,"I don‚Äôt know who this ted guy is, but this book looks dope",Too bad they made me read and annotate this over summer before freshman year. It totally ruined the book for me since I was too focused filling the page with annotations to actually enjoy the book.,"There are 4 books I believe everyone should read:
""Fahrenheit 451"" by Ray Bradbury
""Animal Farm"" by George Orwell
""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" by George Orwell
""We"" by Yegnevy Zamyatin
These 4 books are some of the best critics against authoritarianism and censorship. Animal Farm shows how authoritarian regimes form. Fahrenheit 451 shows life in a way similar to parts of our own world in which the regime is accepted, banning certain things (In Fahrenheit 451 they ban books but the media and news corporations are against conservativism, capitalism, and patriotism). 1984 shows when a regime holds only minor resistance and has absolute power, the regime is the center and plenty blindly follow it blaming everything on one enemy and simplification of everything. I believe ""We"" shows the worst of it though. We is a book written by a Russian man just after Lenin had taken over. His book is an absolute critic against communism and authoritarianism, making him one of the first if not the first author banned by the Soviet Union. We shows life in a regime that holds far more power than Oceania in 1984 but with the comfort and acceptance by society as seen in Fahrenheit 451. We shows the One State as the absolute most terrible form of authoritarianism. In We life is scheduled down to the millisecond for every individual citizen from when they eat, sleep, work, have free time, and even what they do in that free time and with whom. Emotion, culture, individualism, freedom, privacy, resistance, disagreement, debate, it is all gone. It is truly what the worst authoritarians dreamed that they could achieve. There is no nature in We, only a society more decided on algorithm than morals.","Imma keep it real with you chief,

TPCpXXBHFSA,Why gamers use WASD to move,"First person shooters mean WASD. The history of the keyboard default involves a gaming legend and the start of a new era in games.

Correction: At 3:36, a previous version of this video misassigned the keys, the error has been fixed

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

To see more of Thresh, check out the eSports episode of Explained on Netflix: www.netflix.com/explained

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox‚Äôs Phil Edwards explores the history of a common default keyboard configuration among gamers. Though there‚Äôs an inherent logic to WASD ‚Äî it just works well ‚Äî there‚Äôs also a story behind how it became a near-universal standard.

Dennis ‚ÄúThresh‚Äù Fong was one of the first pro gamers to go mainstream playing the first person shooter Quake. By doing so, he set a standard for other gamers to aspire to, including his key control configuration. He discovered that for a new era in which the mouse and keyboard needed to work together, WASD was a great way to do it. Shortly after that, programmers incorporated his schema into their own games, making it a default that millions ‚Äî whether they knew Thresh or not ‚Äî would play with. WASD became a standard for a lot of games because of one superstar‚Äôs amazing record with it.

A5GgBTFSUu4,Why It's So Hard To Make Better Batteries: Crash Course Engineering #32,"There are batteries powering so many parts of our everyday lives, so today we‚Äôre going to talk about how they work and how we can make them better. We‚Äôll explain how they provide power by discharging ions between a cathode and an anode, and how reversing that process gives us a way of charging them. We‚Äôll also look at how that batteries deliver voltage differently over time, leading to discharge curves, and some of the work being done to improve the properties of batteries for portable electronics.

I get it's ""hard"" and ""dangerous"" but why?","Dont get me wrong, i enjoyed the video, and i learned some things, but why make a title that seems very secondary after you actually watche the video  ? How about a title like (different batteries and how they work) that's more like it.","I think the editing was tightened up too much in this video. There isn't enough break between her sentences, and it is just a constant run on stream of information. Let it breathe a little.",Engineering is so fascinating because it ranges from something as small as a battery to something as large as a skyscraper!,So glad you referred to the dendrite issue! So many people think it is so easy to advance the physics and chemistry involved.,"The problem with higher energy densities is that those batteries, in the event of failure, could be lethal. Increase energy density of iPhone battery 10 times and it‚Äôd be equivalent of carrying small C4 charge in your pocket. So batteries of the future should not only be denser, but also safer. And that‚Äôs the challenge.","0:53 I‚Äôm confused - I‚Äôve always learned that the anode is the positive? I learned the mnemonic PANIC = positive anode, negative in cathode.","üëç

Zoos are fascinating places. Nowhere else on Earth can you observe animals from all over the world in one location. Unfortunately, in accomplishing this, zoos rely on imprisoned animals. Yes, ‚Äúimprisoned‚Äù is a harsh word, but it‚Äôs 100% correct. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that zoos are completely unethical. Many zoos house rescued animals, which are usually either captive animals that were discarded or wild animals that were injured. And even if zoos house wild-caught animals, they implement breeding programs that ensure the survival of endangered species. Also, it should go without saying, the education that zoos provide the public is priceless. With all this being said, freedom is in every animal‚Äôs nature, and despite the comfort and privilege bestowed on zoo animals, they won‚Äôt pass up an opportunity for escape. Some even create opportunities themselves, like the crafty animals that you‚Äôll see in this video.

It only ended well because she knew personally just the right person... not all of us have that luxury. 

I for one think the girl was completely in the right, punching the kid for harassing her, and that she was being treated at the Badguy in this situation,when all she was doing was defending herself, was insane... and OFC the boys Parents are gonna side with him over everyone else, because of Bias(which you can't blame them for).

Kid should of got Suspended tho,  really beat(figuratively) into him that sort of behavior is not allowed, because he'll likely grow up and do far worse...

You have to defend yourself, and the fact society these days seems to suggest just ""Grin and Bear it"" just allows people to get abused and grow up with trauma, and allows the Abusers to just keep getting their kicks, and inevitably getting worse.",sexism man i cant belive they defended that boy,now thats how its done..,Bro I just came within the 2mins this was posted LOL wtf,This was posted a week ago on this channel!!!,How many girls would fight back against a bully?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIj9nu3u8nI

Keep it up Dieter and The Verge!",So refreshing to see actual journalism.,"I'm no fan of apple, but i must admit, they've perfected marketing to  such a level only other companies can look at them for new ways to improve their marketing too,  apple has lead the way on that front.","This is a really, really smart video. Great analysis.","Nice analysis through and through, Dieter explained it so well again.

It's known that Apple is the master at marketing, but few people know why actually. The storytelling method allows the companies to place the product in your life and showing how their product can change your life. But every year, Apple manages to convince most people that there's a breakthrough in all of their new products that will add something awesome to your life. Even if it's something archaic like dual SIM support.

And I almost want to take a bite from the glass-metal constructions when the commercials kick in. The renders of the products are so damn glorious.","You have to admit. The audience was MOST excited when the EKG feature was announced. It was a minute of the true innovation Apple was known for. The rest... yeah, framing.","What a great video, entrepreneurs that are launching new products should learn about this strategies to position their products at the top.

Love is in the air in Hollywood, and it sometimes comes in mysterious ways for some of the most famous people in the world. In a society where it can be difficult to find something genuine and real, and a business where fakery is the norm, there are people working in showbiz who long for something real. We've all heard about Hollywood love stories and how they can be so conventional. And yet, there are some truly interesting love stories out there that star some of today's most prominent celebrities. If anything, many of these stories seem real, and we can actually relate to the famous people involved. These celebrity couples already live such extraordinary lives, so it should be no surprise that they met their other half through amazing means as well.

This is not revolutionary, and is wholly unnecessary for any device that is to function as a ""gaming rig"".

T2LAd43JoP4,Why Black Panther‚Äôs box office success matters,"Movies spotlighting people of color are kicking ass right now. 

Read our full review of Black Panther on Vox.com: http://bit.ly/2ExE9xf

The buzz around the Black Panther movie release should come as no surprise to anyone keeping tabs on representation in media these days. People want movies that feature people of color and their stories. But there is a dearth in the supply of films produced that do that. Vox spoke with the UCLA sociology professor Darnell Hunt about how Hollywood has progressed to diversify its characters and stories to reflect the demographics of the US. Watch this video to understand how America‚Äôs changing makeup is key to Black Panther‚Äôs early dominance at the box office.

0sKN7yYC42g,The golf ball that made golfers too good,"Golf's distance debate, explained.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

These days, pro golfers are hitting the ball far. Really far. And it's creating a problem: because modern golfers can reach the hole with fewer shots than before, older courses -- like Augusta National Golf Club, Oakmont Country Club, and others -- are becoming obsolete. Now, professional organizations, like the United States Golf Association, are struggling to find a solution for big powerful golfers like Dustin Johnson, Bubba Watson, and Tiger Woods. While the jump in distance is due to lots of factors, conversation is centering on the controversial possibility of redesigning the golf ball to reduce distance. It'd be the latest turn in the ball's long history: Golf balls have evolved from ""featheries,"" to gutties, to balata balls, and eventually dimpled modern balls. But the biggest, and most recent change? The almost-instantaneous switch from wound balls to solid core multilayer balls like the Titleist Pro V1.

Thank you so much for this work of inspiration. My son Ian is autistic; he's not verbal, though my wife and I worked with him. I spend a large part of my time trying to come up with ways to make his world better because his brother and sisters can experience the satisfaction of playing games on the Nintendo DS systems. He holds a single string that he likes to change in shape. He likes dance music. I've bought electronic devices to attempt a connect to his thoughts in that way. But mostly I hold him tight and when I see him smile, I know that he knows that I love him.",Thank you for everything.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORhFIInTXMs

Also, I am aware of the fact that I feel this way going into the Project for Awesome every year, so I should not be surprised. And yet somehow I always am! Also, although I do have anxiety problems, I don't want y'all to worry that this is part of a larger thing. I am just stressed out because too much is happening, not because I am falling into the tightening gyre! (...I think!)

Thank you Mrs. Newman !,Teachers are some of the most hardest working yet underpaid and underappreciated people.,This is the first ad that I actually did not skip and WENT Out of my way to find like and comment on it. It is such a loving video and everyone should always remember that teachers are some of the best people. They are the people we spend most of our time when we are young and most only want the best for us and see us as their kids. I love this video. (Plus i want to be a teacher someday),"every time i see this video,it makes me happy because of courage,kindness and more..........","Great video, love the positive energy and inspirational core message. And thanks for suggesting Search Phrases for the Learning and Teaching Niches. So much info to gather from this video by just reading between the lines. I admire teachers for their dedication (The Ones that are Really Passionate), as you have so elegantly illustrated. Knowledge is the Only Key to Success, and we should appreciate teachers like these. Give them all the support they need as they give so much, always remember they also get drained and may just need those few kind words of encouragement they so selflessly give. And so richly deserve. Thanks for an Outstanding Video Google.","Got some chills,. Nice inspirational video.",Wtf i saw my principle,"Teachers are the best. They end up getting so underpaid and have to use personal funds for teaching.

Some of the teachers I have had made me feel smart and wanted. Isn't that important?",This video is so beautiful. Now if more school systems would just let this happen it would truly be glorious.,Teachers are doing an amazing job. I'm glad to see Google is supporting them. Google in general seems to stand for good values. I like that.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XVUQZHKFbU

He probably would of ate his phone then cough up a frog.,"This trick is really easy to explain. When Dan White places QuestLove's cell phone into the box, he then calls upon the power of Ancistroides Nigrita, a chocolate butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae, to move the cell phone from the box into the yarn and then summons and leaves behind a chocolate bar instead. People are so stupid to be fooled by this!",Quest has Playing cards on his phone case?!,Jimmy manages to turn every episode into some fraction of the birthday party he always wanted as a kid.. but never got to have.,"Jesus H Christ!

eP-v8kBfGRk,Cops Investigating Weird Man-Made -Sinkhole- Learn It's Part of a Much Larger Criminal Scheme,"Have you ever dreamed of pulling off the perfect heist? An easy way to get millions of dollars without any risk? One man thought that this would be a good idea. Unfortunately, he did the work but didn't get the payoff. He took the time to dig a hole which police thought was a sinkhole. He left his equipment and his muddy boots behind, but he wasn't able to pull off the heist. Someone should have told this guy that the perfect heist only happens in the movies. 
You have to see the video to believe how foolish the would-be thief was. His heist attempt may have worked in the movies, but in the real world, the guy didn't stand a chance.

Humans have three basic needs in life: food, shelter, and clothing. The more well off you are, in terms of money, the more extravagant you can become with your needs. For those who are yearning for a sense of adventure, then perhaps a home in a suburban neighborhood doesn‚Äôt quite cut it. Someone might want to get away from conventional civilization so badly that they seclude themselves in a remote area. This can result in some incredible creativity when it comes to home architecture and design. Sure, it might seem like a good idea to build a house on the side of a cliff, but it can be a complicated process. This means that the strangest home locations in the world are also some of the most impressive. Watch this video to be amazed at how innovative people can get with their homes. Thanks to brilliant minds all over the world, anyone can have their own personal oasis almost anywhere.

This multifaceted guy isn't just a comedian though, he's also built himself quite a career in the film industry. It's clear that he's building an empire, but his life wasn't always so luxurious.

He is so rich that he never has to worry about money again. Curious to know how he spends his money? Like most rich men, he has a penchant for fancy watches and luxurious cars. But Kevin Hart is also a family man, and he will spare no expense to make his family happy. Make sure to watch until the end to hear about the greatest gift that he ever gave his kids for Christmas.

Turn on the news today and you‚Äôre absolutely bombarded by a few key topics. It seems like we‚Äôre always talking about BREXIT, Taylor Swift, Donald Trump or North Korea. In fact, the Hermit Kingdom ruled by Kim Jong-Un has been taking up quite a few headlines ‚Äì especially since the summer of 2017. With the fiery rhetoric being used, dramatic speeches coming out of Pyongyang and much publicized images of missile launches, it‚Äôs hard not to be a little concerned. That said, even with the international tension ramping up and experts saying we are edging closer and closer to war, most of us still don‚Äôt take the Northern regime very seriously. After all, they are backwards, poor and an ill-equipped nation that will likely fall apart if things go badly ‚Äì right? Well, maybe not. Stick around and let us show you just how dangerous this small isolated nation actually is.

1. That doesnt make them more dangerous
2. Their militarys motivation is weak, I would say about 1/10 would desert straight away given the chance, and they are poorly trained and equipped + North korea doesnt have resources for long war
3. Their nukes are still stone age and just one nuke would cripple their entire nation and for the other weapons major nations have everything what they have but only more
4. Everybody knew that Kim Jong Oink is fat and ruthless warmonger who would just sit in his office when war happens.
5.  This might be true but major nations have more of these 
6.  Propaganda unites people but it also tears them apart once they see that it was all a lie + watch my second point about their peoples motivation
7.  This doesnt gain them enough resources to be considered ""more dangerous""
8. Major nations still have more nukes and the country is crippled if one nuke hits their capital
9. Their missiles are from cold war so they are not going far with over 30 years old equipment
10. China only promised to defend them if they get attacked if North Korea attacks against somebody China does not support them

Just saying that this North Korea stuff has been around for decades and all they do is talk talk and talk, they are simply too weak to do anything. If they would attack somebody they would get almost instantly pushed back and people of North Korea would be freed under Unified Korea, sure they could do massive amount of casualties with nuke but they would still get destroyed. I hope I live to see that day when Unified Korea is a thing and Im throwing wild guess that sometime when west has got enough of truth to their people they will rebel and overthrow government.
Feel free to comment if you disagree with my points",I'm personally more worried about Americans and their weapons of mass destruction.,I don't even know why it hasn't collapsed,"I love your vids keep up the good work guys, and you inform us with so much important information","Consistently whacking out North Korea vids.

He was fine when he was diagnosed,"" ""The View"" co-host said of her father Sen. John McCain.",2018-03-07T08:32:34.000Z,363026.0,2141.0,386.0,896,"I don't see her as an intelligent giant. Her points of view are confusing and am not sure she even understands her own conservative ideology. Her statements about Trump are incredulous and she wants an apology from Trump. What would that mean? All is forgiven then. So true with Repugs, stab you in the back, say I'm sorry and all is A-okay. No principles, no convictions.","Megan is a spoiled,self centered brat. She's consistently name dropping.  Who she knows, who her father is friends with,  who her Godfather is. For God's sake grow up Megan. It's not who you know, that makes you tolerable,  but, your    attitude.",She is thinned skinned and talks over people.,"It's great when each and one of these hosts will be as honest and true to themselves without being afraid to acknowledge and defend their opinions....... BUT, half the time Meghan McCain only sounds hypocritical. Like still defending Trump after all the insults thrown to her dying father.",She's so emotional and entitled and trust me before seasons end she will say something that will get her fired,"The People that Voted for Trump, Brought this own them selves. Trump imitates their True Values and Guess what , It is Not Godly! It would of been better to Not Vote at all than to Vote for some one from the beginning  who  told You he was a Snake! He showed You from the beginning he has No Morals and Values. He ""Used People for a Vote for Ungodly Reasons, himself! Wake Up! You trusted a man, not God! God will ""Not be Mocked""","I understand  Meghan  ideas .  She has much-needed   thoughts  & beliefs  to keep the  show honest. However  her approach  is always combative & somewhat condensing .  Often  her ideas are lost because  she says things like ""as the only republican   so she knows  all of the audience  doesn't  understand  her "" I find that offensive &  akin to not being smart enough to understand her views. Calm down  and  give the rest of us credit  that we are smart enough to  get  her ideas .",She is too emotional and tribal. Anna Navarro shut her down when Meghan tried to say she wasn't a republican.,"Her husband is much more conservative than she is?? He MUST be a huge nationalist and more than averse to dating outside of his race. It's a fact: the more conservative you are, the less humane you are, if more illogical, as well.",Meghan doesn't look right at home on the set of the View. I have been watching it on and off for 20 years and she is the most uncomfortable looking host on that show ever. She looks directly at the camera on a regular basis. I just feel she doesn't want to be there.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFYx4DwOq4k

It‚Äôs no secret that many of our favorite celebrities had varying careers before they hit their big break. It‚Äôs rare for actors to get lucky and work on big budget movies right away‚Äîalthough it does happen occasionally. But for the celebs on this list, it took a lot of hard work and dedication before they got to where they are today. And all of their career paths included being a stripper somewhere along the way. While some of them opted to become an exotic dancer for the pure enjoyment and adrenaline that comes with the job, others did it for the money. However, none of them seem to have had a bad experience, and many speak of the fun that they had while working as a stripper. Some of these celebs even frequent the club that they used to work at to reminisce about those days.

She is a sighthound, she will take off whenever she sees something to chase and will not respond to commands,
 it is her nature. We can train her to the best of our ability but part of adopting a rescue greyhound is agreeing that your dog will never be off leash unless they are in a fully fenced in environment (or are on a leash). They are very different dogs in that sense and no matter how much we would love to let her run on a beach, even an off leash dog beach,  safety already comes first and foremost with her.  Even well trained former racing Greys can have this as a safety issue, and we would never let her run free unless we were in a fully fenced in environment.  I hope you all can understand why this is the safest and best way currently in our state for her to enjoy the beach and if you are curious about rescue greyhoudsntonjist have a quick look on the internet. They are wonderful companions but do require some extra safety measures due to their ... well sighthoundedness lol.

CKE6_2o7DMo,"This Is How ""Tyrion Lannister"" Peter Dinklage Spends His Millions","Peter Dinklage, ""Tyrion Lannister"" or ""The Imp"" from Game Of Thrones is an iconic actor loved by many for his wit, intellect and funny moments. You've probably also seen him in other famous movies like Marvel's Avengers and the X-Men Series! 

His measures of secrecy are so effective he‚Äôs even managed to conceal the name of his first child and the name and gender of his second. We‚Äôve got to give him props: that‚Äôs some CIA-level covering up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dgsr2isuj80

This doesn‚Äôt mean, however, that nothing about Dinklage‚Äôs private life is known. In this video we will reveal a lot of stuff that you may not have known about the man who plays Tyrion Lannister, like the fact that he‚Äôs a vegan, or that he likes spending time in Ireland possibly more than America, or that how he actually got the scar on his face!

We also know how much he makes for Game of Thrones. While his season four salary was $160,000 an episode, his season five salary was $300,000 an episode, and his season seven salary was $500,000 an episode. These pale in comparison to the salary he was paid for Game of Thrones‚Äô eighth and final season. 

Dinklage can‚Äôt hide that he‚Äôs a millionaire many times over, just as he can‚Äôt hide everything that he spends his money on ‚Äì though he would if he could.

IGgpoI_0oPs,Why Do So Few Countries Have Nukes?,"There are a lot of perspectives on this one, and in many ways we are lucky that it is so hard to separate one isotope of uranium from another because, if it were easier, we probably would have destroyed ourselves by now. 

One thing I didn't hit on in this video is that there are some experts that argue that the world has experienced greater peace and prosperity because of nuclear weapons and that they have done more good than harm. That's a commonly held viewpoint...that the threat of nuclear weapons has prevented major powers from going to war with each other. This has maybe increased the rate of proxy wars, which has been bad for the Middle East, some of Africa, and a particular Asian Peninsula, but it's better, they say, than World War III. 

What I want to remember, however, is that this isn't just something that was inevitable...so thank you to everyone who worked to create this more stable world. I hope we can maintain it.

Fun fact: in the early Middle Ages, cutting off someone‚Äôs pinky finger had the next biggest fine after cutting off their thumb. The thumb was what was believed to be a symbol of their humanity, yet to cut off the little finger was one of the largest ways to humiliate people. 

So putting that point on your pinky finger actually works!","Hey Hank, did you know USA supported Pakistan against India in war of 1971, by even sending a warship in Indian ocean against India, stopped by Russians thus accelerating Indian need to protect it's borders by having nuclear weapons against China and Pakistan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGgpoI_0oPs

Aristophanes, often referred to as the Father of Comedy, wrote the world‚Äôs earliest surviving comic dramas. They're stuffed full of parodies, songs, sexual jokes and surreal fantasy -- and they‚Äôve shaped how comedy‚Äôs been written and performed ever since.

Weapons are fascinating tools of destruction, they can destroy and push people‚Äôs opinions in a certain direction. They can be used to achieve goals that without them wouldn‚Äôt be possible. They‚Äôre also the tools that can directly cause a lot of horrors, as history can tell you. 

The history of weapons basically started when someone picked up a rock or stick and decided to bash in the head of another human being. Thousands of years later,  there is the tank in the first world war. Not too long after that, there‚Äôs modern weaponry which is constantly changing due to the needs to combat groups. Whether it be creating a lighter version of a gun so a soldier can go on long patrols or simply adding a large collar to a bulletproof vest so that same soldier doesn‚Äôt die from shrapnel hitting them in that area. These things are being improved to save lives, however, It almost seems like weapons have existed and been advanced simply to make killing each other more efficient over time.

There are 3 traits, called the ""Dark Triad,"" which when found simultaneously in an individual, indicate a high likelihood of sociopathic behavior. They are Narcissism, shallow empathy, and Machiavellianism. 
Psychopathy adds a 4th trait: Sadism. This, with the previous three traits, are known as the ""Dark Tetrad."" 


You can find personality profiles online that can give you an idea of how high you rate on any of these traits, but an online test in NOT a substitute for a clinical diagnosis.

PgSRAsgrKmg,How do crystals work? - Graham Baird,"What makes crystals grow into their signature shapes? Dig into the atomic patterns and unique properties of crystals.
 
--

Many crystals have signature shapes‚Äî like the cascade of pointed quartz or a pile of galena cubes. Every crystal‚Äôs atoms have a defining feature: their organized, repeating pattern. The pattern isn't restricted to minerals- sand, ice, metals and DNA also have crystalline structures. So what causes them to grow into these shapes again and again? Graham Baird dives into the unique properties of crystals.

TM42O6kYbI8,Why the Oscars love method actors,"Almost half of all Best Actor and Actress awards have been won by method actors since 1951.

Method acting's foundational theory originated in the Soviet Union during the early 20th century. It was created by Konstantin Stanislavski and his peers at the Moscow Art Theater as a framework for systematically training young actors. Method acting became influential in the US in the ‚Äô30s and ‚Äô40s, pioneered by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner, each of whom transformed and built on Stanislavski‚Äôs system.

Today, training in method acting is ubiquitous for aspiring actors. But at the same time, the stakes of method acting continue to rise. First popularized in the US during the 1950s by Marlon Brando's generation of Hollywood stars, method acting continues to be a consistent way for actors to push themselves in new roles. But while method acting won Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar for his performance in The Revenant, it's undeniable that the way method acting is promoted is conspicuously marketable. Still, it has undoubtedly led to some of the greatest performances of all time.

n1mwZrVJ-TI,The murder of ancient Alexandria's greatest scholar - Soraya Field Fiorio,"Dive into the life of one of Ancient Rome‚Äôs most powerful figures, Hypatia of Alexandria, a renowned scholar and political advisor to the city's leaders.

--

In the city of Alexandria in 415 CE, the bishop and the governor were in a fight. It started with a disagreement over the behavior of a militia of monks, and ended with an accusation of witchcraft leveled against one of the most powerful figures in the city: Hypatia, philosopher and advisor to the city‚Äôs leaders. Who was Hypatia and why was she deemed a threat? Soraya Field Fiorio investigates.

From asteroids capable of destroying entire species to supernovae that could exterminate life on Earth, outer space has no shortage of forces that could wreak havoc on our planet. But there‚Äôs something in space that is even more terrifying than any of these -- something that wipes out everything it comes near. Fabio Pacucci examines the probability of Earth being gobbled up by a black hole.

This is my life as a Father to my sons Noah and Kane and our new baby girl, along with my Wife Brittney in Ohio. I‚Äôve made pranks on YouTube since 2010 and vlogs since 2013. This channel is family-friendly and kid-friendly, so everyone can join in on the fun! I love you all! Roman soldiers baby!",2018-11-22T19:57:28.000Z,1077315.0,43562.0,473.0,4074,Thank you all so much for hanging out! HAPPY THANKSGIVING!! See you Tomorrow.,"I always watch the vlogs but never comment, until now. I am so disgusted at some of the comments towards Brit and the level of disrespect from one human being to another. Just because people vlog their lives and put it out there in public, it does not give people the right to bully them and make them feel so bad. Brit is beautiful, she is a fabulous mother and clearly makes Roman amazingly happy. People were not just commenting on her teeth but also saying that she is ‚Äòmoney hungry‚Äô they are both married, they both do the vlogs and as much as there will be huge benefits to this, there are huge negatives too,why not enjoy the rewards? . I can‚Äôt help think that if the bullies on here were happy with their own lives then they wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to try and upset other people. Imagine how you‚Äôd feel if someone was saying these things to a member of your family.  Please just remember, when you make these impacting comments, you then go about your day and don‚Äôt think about it again but the person you were targeting will be affected by the comments for much longer. Be nice people or move on.","Probably crying because of all the arse hole comments in yesterday's vlog! If you haven't got anything nice to say, don't say anything","Man who cares if she‚Äôs done her teeth or her breast. If it makes her feel better about her self then let it be a positive thing. I‚Äôm sure if you were insecure about something and could do something about it you would. The point of this channel, this community of people is about positivity, so why spread that negative mind set. Encourage the positivity, leave the negativity behind. Even if life can‚Äôt always be positive always try, even with how hard it must be Roman and Brit show 95% positivity even tho they‚Äôre prob having bad days 2-3 times a week sometimes. Everyone should stand together, not against each other.",And 5 years later you will see a bear walking in the house.üòÇ,When the pond freezes write smile more in gas and light it with that,"""I'm the cookie turker"" -Roman Atwood 2018","Brit, dont listen to all the little kids talking bad about you they're just jealous and talking bad about other people makes them feel better about themselves

also, lot's of sites and apps have night mode. it helps me a lot personally to have dark mode on.

For copyright matters please contact us at: david.f@valnetinc.com
 
March Madness rivals the World Series, Super Bowl, and NBA Finals in popularity. And in terms of pure competition, this college tournament is often the most exciting. Since it uses a single-elimination format, the tournament plays more like Russian roulette than a sporting event. Every game is sudden death; every team puts all they have into every game. It‚Äôs epic, plain and simple. Doing much to boost the popularity of March Madness is the bracket system, which is the perfect model for sports betting. People, who care more about personal victory than any team‚Äôs success, fill out their bracket sheets and compete against millions to see who‚Äôs the most accurate. This fuels the tournament‚Äôs fire, making people truly ‚Äúmad‚Äù for March Madness. It‚Äôs the best tournament for joint sports and fan participation. It‚Äôs multi-level competition. It‚Äôs Sportception.

It‚Äôs not just the largest iPhone ever, it‚Äôs one of the largest phones out there, period.

fn8Ok3ipZ-8,"It's Time to Care About ""Business""","All work is business, and even if you're very isolated from the business parts, those things are very important to understand. You can watch Crash Course Business here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFeEAtXdzFU&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtMBsfP-lP28IFvfkISqJofM&index=2

I think the very idea of ""business school"" is a problem...the idea that business is separate from the rest of work. No. It's all business, and I think employees at every level should be given the capacity and the tools to understand the value of the work they are doing, and what role they play in a business. I also think that we should be opening the door to allowing more people who aren't like, passionate about becoming billionaires to be interested and aware of how business works. 

I recognize that I come at this from a somewhat bizarre and very privileged perspective, but I deeply want more diversity in business...and I don't mean ""people of all genders and skin colors"" I mean ""people who don't all subscribe to the particular worldview you are presented with in business school"" (though, for clarity, I think having people of all genders and skin colors and backgrounds would HELP WITH THAT A LOT).

ANYWAY! Business is weird and fascinating, and you should watch Crash Course.

-John","I watch vlogbrothers because I like to hear people who are educated about the realities of the world and yet are consistently hopeful for it, and actively try to be a part of the solution than being a part of the problem.","This channel has had a non-trivial impact on my growth as a person. Over the years, my attention has been brought to things that I may not otherwise notice, connections have been made for me about the world that I may not have otherwise made, and, just like the first season did over 11 years ago, I've been able to see what the future looks like. When I was a kid, watching vlogbrothers made me embrace adulthood instead of being fearful of it (because hank & john sure seem like they're doing fine) and today, as an adult, i continue to embrace whatever comes next.

that and it's increased my interest in third tier english football by ‚àû%","I personally love your enthusiasm and unironic love of each other and things in general. You seem like lovely, genuine people, and although you're in the thick of the internet, and know about all the trends and slang and its obsession with self deprecation, you guys have kept yourselves separate. You're the happy-go-lucky uncles of Youtube. The ones you don't block on facebook and actually go visit from time to time. You've always used your platform for good and have never taken ill advantage of your audience. And that, in itself, is so admirable.","Vlogbrothers makes us happy. We watch your videos because we think you are important.  We love John's books and we love hank's music (and soon to be released book) the only thing that we get out of this is a little hope, happiness, and laughter in our day. Thank you, John and Hank, so much for making our lives better you guys truly made a difference in our lives. We hope this channel never ends but when it does we will continue to be nerdfighters and fight world suck. DFTBA","One of the most important things about vlogbrothers to me is that I know I can trust you guys; John, Hank, and everyone else here. The internet has become more and more confusing with hoax, hate, useless debates and what not. Coming to the nerdfighter's corner of the internet feels like coming home: safe and welcoming. Though of course its not perfect, but anything everyone does in this community is based on love and the wish to make the world better. And it is a wonderful feeling to be part of that.",England just won on penalties mate no one has any clue what the future holds,"I was raised in a small, conservative town in the Southern US. I don't resent that, and I don't wish I'd been raised elsewhere. But I did not grow up in an environment that encouraged open, honest questioning of important personal and interpersonal issues, or in an environment that fostered unironic enthusiasm for things that were considered ""nerdy"" or otherwise non-conventional for a male. I found vlogbrothers in 2008, when I was 14. I credit vlogbrothers for a large portion of why I ended up being the person I became. I'm the first man in my family to graduate from college, an openly progressive person with a fire for social issues, and I try my best to listen to marginalized groups and work with them to accomplish their societal goals. I wouldn't be this person without you, John and Hank. I watch vlogbrothers because the two of you essentially helped raise me. And I'm proud to have been part of this community for so long.",I'm a month late but I'm a big fan of three weeks of unpunished vacation. Why not four? Time away let's the work be more precious and exciting when you come back to it.,"I'm 65 and suspect I'm not your normal demographic, my daughter introduced me to your channel about 5 years ago. I find I'm watching more and more during these troubling times.  I have cut out most news sources (ostrich syndrome) and find you and Hank so informative and entertaining.  Thank you and please don't stop you're a bright spot in a very dark world. #newoldnerdfighter",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyliPHeAppA

I am so sorry to be that person ü§£","Umm, actually... Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny are not in EVERY town","Um, actually, even though he's mentioned in the title of the video, none of the questions have anything to do with Peter Pevensie or the Chronicles of Narnia.","Um, actually Becca was right. There were two things wrong with the Cowboy Bebop statement, Faye is indeed older however ""a genetically enhanced corgi known as Data Dog"" is an incorrect statement, Ein is only ever referred to as being ""that data dog"" or ""a data dog"" which rules it out as a proper noun. 
The correct statement should end ""and Ein; a genetically enhanced corgi known as a data dog.""","i love zac oyama, zac oyama is the only good person in the whole world","Um, actually Storm is NOT from Kenya - her mother was. Storm was born in the USA and spent her childhood in Egypt - before moving to Tanzania as a young adult where she was recruited by Prof X.
Also - I'm seriously triggered that not everone knows that Wolverine is Canadian!","uhm, actually, the image show fenix from starcraft 1, before tassadar really died, and being glorified with the high call EN TARO TASSADAR. they never use adun tassadar, but adun toridas


and also, i want dropout on italy","Um actually the shiny question is wrong regarding StarCraft. ""Adun Tassadar"" makes absolutely no sense - those are both names without the important honoring part. It is either ""Adun Toridas (for Nerazim) / En Taro Adun"" or ""En Taro Tassadar"".

 ""En taro"" in this case means ""in honor of"", with Adun and Tassadar being separate individuals. ""Adun Tassadar"" as a phrase would be like saying ""Washington Jefferson"" instead of ""in honor of Washington"" or ""in honor of Jefferson"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UsX0KvPhRY

So pretty much on the nose.,THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BACKGROUND CHECK,I noticed that he had his finger OFF of the trigger and to the side the whole video. Most actors miss that piece of gun safety. He either knows guns or did good research. I'm giving a like just because of that.,"""What do you even need that thing for?""

""HUNTING.""

Republican gun lobbyists suddenly became concerned with checks and regulations when Black Panthers begun to arm themselves.,Imagine seeing a group of Arabs at a NRA gun show.,‚ÄúWe have a well regulated militia‚Äù lmao üòÇ,"See, this is exactly what happened in the sixties when the Black Panthers started packing heat. Suddenly, conservative white politicians were saying ""I've got nothing agianst deer hunting, but when groups of peole start walking around on our city streets openly carrying guns, something needs to be done."" This guy has a black beret, as the black panthers did, so I think this skit is directly refrencing them.",I wish to learn more about the knife crossbow.,"ya know, this might actually work. like get a bunch of black and muslim people speaking for the NRA and see how long gun laws stay the same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJqfNroFp8U

She is disabled and dealing with a serious and potentially fatal health condition (craniocervical instability I think) and doesn't have the money to access the doctors she needs since she is excluded from Medicare and Medicaid. We've been talking in the Nerdfighteria Facebook group about setting up a fundraiser but we really need your help. We've sent emails to you and John (along with Maureen and some other people that are able to get in contact with you all). She estimates that the medical costs would be around $10-15k. She's getting progressively worse and if she doesn't get treatment she will die. We are all ready to help, but we need to get the word out. I think she's found nerdfighters in her area to help with rides to appointments and running errands, but she still needs financial help. Making a video detailing her situation and linking a fundraiser could save her life.

I learned a lot in making this video and the one on my second channel with Prof. Jon Arnou. I changed a lot of my preconceptions, specifically I thought:

1. That the Earth's magnetic field was a passive thing - it shouldn't need a continuous input of energy to maintain itself (that seemed reasonable to me because the magnetic field has been around for a long time and it seems mostly stable). But as it turns out, the Earth is a giant electromagnet, and so of course those currents dissipate their energy as they encounter resistance in the liquid metal through which they flow. So the energy to continuously create these currents comes from the kinetic energy of the liquid metal flows in the Earth's outer core.

2. If it's convection, I'm thinking hot things rising, cooler things falling. But apparently the main effect driving convection is the compositional differences at the boundary with the Earth's inner core. This is because of the differential freezing at the boundary. Things like iron freeze into the inner core, while elements like sulfur do not. Hence the pockets of lighter material which then rise outwards.

3. I didn't get why the fluid motion was necessary for the generation of the magnetic field. I mean if it's a conducting liquid, it can conduct currents whether it moves or not. But the key is that the liquid metal can 'trap' magnetic fields. I imagine this like how iron channels magnetic fields. Then once these fields are channeled, they can be pulled and stretched, making more magnetic field.

4. Fluids operate very differently in rotating frames of reference. This is something I didn't intuitively grasp. But, as fluids move from the inner core outwards, those particles are moving much more slowly in the direction of rotation than the matter that has been there for a long time, which means the convection currents get deflected and form helices.

ih4dY9i9JKE,Using Wikipedia: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #5,"Let's talk about Wikipedia. Wikipedia is often maligned by teachers and twitter trolls alike as an unreliable source. And yes, it does sometimes have major errors and omissions, but Wikipedia is also the Internet's largest general reference work and as such an incredibly powerful tool. Today we'll discuss using Wikipedia for good - to help us get a birds-eye view of content, better evaluate information with lateral reading, and find trustworthy primary sources.

We really appreciate when people create content that helps explain to people how the site works and how people should engage with it. We love what you guys do. We support the Wikimedia community in the UK, but our sister charities run events all around the world if people want to learn how to edit Wikipedia and improve free knowledge online.","don't cite wikipidia as a source, cite the sources at the bottom",And we all know Wikipedia is great as a starter site to understand the basics of topics,I‚Äôm still very annoyed that in the intro you‚Äôre using ‚Äúwikipedia.com‚Äù instead of the much more commonly used ‚Äúwikipedia.org‚Äù.,"I'm amazed how often people undervalue Wikipedia! It's the best thing Internet has ever created, after YouTube of course üòÇ",For a brief 2 minutes in 2017 (or was it '18) Wikipedia listed  Paul Ryan under 'Invertebrates',"One thing I've often noticed about Wikipedia, it's articles about mathematics are often impossible to understand. They are full of esoteric jargon and explanations, explaining simple things with way more advanced things. I think this likely says something about the kind of people who end up editing these pages, probably people immersed in their field not really thinking about how to explain a concept to those that don't have all their technical background, or maybe are too eager to get down everything about a topic without understanding how much that confuse someone, especially in math.

It's a very good point in general that Wikipedia is biased towards having more information on topics that are popular among their community. My impression over the years has been that generally ""nerdy"" things do quite well. Just an impression though.","Wikipedia is where you take the first paragraph of your intro, the rest is consulted in more peer-reviewed articles, magazines, books, etc.","i've long taught middle and high school students that wikipedia can be a great source of sources, but, as you said, not a source that you'd actually cite in a school assignment.",aren't you acting in this video?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih4dY9i9JKE

R7N5a476DKQ,Why you're recycling wrong,"Knowing what you can and can‚Äôt recycle isn‚Äôt easy. But when you put stuff that can‚Äôt be recycled into that blue bin, it can turn entire hauls of otherwise recyclable materials into trash. 

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

People try to recycle everything. Waste management workers routinely find bowling balls, batteries, Christmas lights, animal carcasses, even dirty diapers. In 2018, about 25% of items that Americans tried to recycle were actually non-recyclable trash, known as ""contamination."" The more contamination that enters recycling plants, the more likely a waste management company will simply send the entire haul, including items that could be recycled, to a landfill. 

Watch the video above to learn more about why Americans‚Äô recycling habits are trash, and how you can prevent recycling contamination.

Every article I have read included some comments from her ex husband.  Apparently, they were having problems with the marriage for a while, and her ex husband says he had already told her he wanted a divorce BEFORE she was paralyzed.  He didn't just up and leave, he visited her in the hospital often, and he and the kids lived with her for a further 15 months (until she could take care of herself).  Here are some quotes:  

""Whilst she was in hospital I visited as much as I could of an evening.""  
""I had to take care of the children, look after the house and run a business.""  
""I lived in the house with Riona and the kids until last June before I eventually moved out, and we have now both moved on.""

source: https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/25/mum-claims-husband-of-14-years-dumped-her-in-hospital-after-she-suffered-a-stroke-6877970/

You are being very dishonest about the situation.  You make it sound as if he left her BECAUSE she was paralyzed, and that he just left her all alone after the spinal stroke.... none of which is even true.  They were going to get divorced anyway (she has gone on record saying she was ""miserable in my marriage"") so even she admits this was not an overnight decision, and he stayed around for over a year until she could take care of herself.  You also act as if he just took off with the kids, which also is a lie.  In a number of articles, she says that her children were very supportive of her and there are numerous pictures of her with her children AFTER she was paralyzed.  

What you are doing is dishonest and slander, just so you can get some clicks.  They were both unhappy with the marriage and he stayed around for over a year after they were no longer together just to help her.  What the hell else should he have done?  ... and look at all the comments, people calling him trash, people hoping he will die, calling him an asshole, that he is ""the worst husband in history,"" that he's not ""a real man,"" that he is a narcissist psychopath, and so on.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced a plan to bring congestion pricing to New York City. The goal is to raise money for the city‚Äôs crumbling public transit system and reclaim the dangerously busy city streets. But what is congestion pricing, and can it actually solve all our transit woes? 

We took a look at London, a city that enacted a congestion charge in 2003, to see some of the benefits. Check out the video above to learn more.

For further reading look to our sister site, Curbed: https://www.curbed.com/

His face remains a mystery which is actually one of the many reasons for Mello‚Äôs speedy rise to stardom. For the first two years of his career, no one knew who he was. This was thanks to the giant marshmallow helmet that adorned his head and concealed his face. It was also a sure way to attract notice, partly concocted by his manager. But mostly it seems that Mello isn‚Äôt too concerned about how his identity is perceived. It‚Äôs all about the music, which is adored by millions of people. This is the main reason why he‚Äôs so successful ‚Äì his music is universal, transcending the confines of EDM to reach a mainstream audience. This helps explain why he‚Äôs expected to make $50 million in 2019.

This video will explain what Marshmello does with all his millions, and it‚Äôs as unique as you‚Äôd expect from a person with a marshmallow on his head. You‚Äôll learn how much he paid for his helmet. Here‚Äôs a hint: it‚Äôs a solid yearly salary. You‚Äôll learn what he spends on all of his DJing and music production equipment, and the exact products that he uses. You‚Äôll also learn how the purchase of a billboard and security guards at Coachella helped make Marshmello the icon that he is today. Most notably, you‚Äôll get inside info on exactly how Mello makes his money ‚Äì for instance, his going rate for live performances, which he does 170 times a year.
Give it another year before Mello has made so many extraordinary transactions that we‚Äôll need another video to cover it all. If you thought the house he bought in December was amazing, wait till you see his inevitable upgrade.

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-incredible-evolution-of-fish-bodies-lauren-sallan

In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish swims up to 110 kilometers per hour. These feats are made possible by a fish‚Äôs form -- which in most species is a smooth, long body, fins, and a tail. Lauren Sallan explains why these features are so common, and what it reveals about fish.

Pin This If You Agree",I really hope it happens,Deji start training ASAP it's needed,"PLZ start training Deji I need you to beat Jake up because no one else will. I believe you can do it, but just show me ur improving plz","I had huge respect for the olatunji brothers. Especially you deji, cause the way you are so bonded with your parents is adorable. Your dad is really cool. And your mom is love too. But it really annoys me to see you brothers getting off track and running behind views. We all know that JJ called out Logan Paul just for drama and views. I really miss your videos. Your channel has become so negative now deji. You brothers really need to sit and think about this. Also stop putting the Paul brother's names in your titles, it's shameful. I hope you understand man! Tank gang!!",For real tho that Dragon Ball Super Nike Hoodie looks dope,"What a terrible ‚Äúcontract‚Äù. Those terms are ridiculous. Honestly, I think this whole situation is a big cluster but from a purely business perspective, nobody in Logan‚Äôs position would ever agree to such a deal.

You‚Äôre lying to yourself if you say that the Paul brothers don‚Äôt have a bigger reach in terms of pure social media numbers. 

All the hype and clout leads up to the first match, where JJ gets 100% of sale? Then, later down the road in a theoretical rematch, Logan collects the sales? This means LPs team could not get paid until 2019, and still risks the possibility of leaving with 0$, where as KSIs team gets paid no matter what and risks only 50%. No company, agency, production, etc. would bind themselves to these ridiculous terms.

Drama and YouTube politics aside, like KSI, LP is valuable by his sheer reach and growth. The two are bringing each other views, and in turn, $$. In such a deal, where both parties are literally GUARANTEEING sales for the event, in no world would one agree to a contract with such an unfair advantage. 

This will be the biggest YouTube initiated event in history, and it‚Äôs only fair that the two of them play on a perfectly leveled playing field. Business is business. (Keep in mind, same applies for JP and Deji)","idk which ""team"" is the real problem because both sides are blaming the opposing ""team"", but if Logan's team really are the ones who aren't accepting, I think its because of the deal jj's team is trying to make, yes they're gonna have 2 fights, one in UK and one in U.S., and both get 100% from either fight, but you gotta look at it from a business man's perspective, I think that when they say 50/50, I'm pretty sure they mean each side gets 50% *per fight* . Now yes the original deal in the contract shown in the video of each getting 100% from 2 fights may sound like a good deal to some, but from a business perspective it may not, because lets say the UK has a bigger venue,  which means more tickets will be sold and they could potentially make more money than what logan would make in the U.S., and lets say that a lot of people would be excited for the first fight so they would sell out, now by the second fight, people will still be excited for that, but people usually aren't as excited during rematches than the first fight so tickets won't be sold as much as the first fight, meaning it wouldn't be fair because with jj's deal, one side could make way more money than the other, which in my opinion, it would be better if both sides agree on 50/50 *per fight*",I WANT HELL IN A CELL - ALL 4 of you in a cage all fighting free for all! üôÑ make it happen,Deji talks a lot of beef for not being able to throw a proper punch and taking a hit from his brother.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9obHZ_1RIws

In the pursuit of faster computers, Intel and other computer processor manufacturers started implementing a design feature known as ‚Äúspeculative execution.‚Äù That enables a computer to make necessary calculations before the user needs them. The problem? That feature now has the potential to be exploited to reveal sensitive data. And to make matters worse, these flawed computer chips have been around since 1995‚Ä¶

Branch Prediction
Who's there?","As a computer science student, I can't approve of the explanation in this video. I understand that it has to be abstract to reach a broad audience, but the video implies a couple incorrect statements:
1. These bugs were caused by reckless innovation to appease a public that insatiably desires faster devices
2. Your computer processor is doing large tasks that it was never asked to do.

These are both very misleading.
1. Speculative execution was one obvious way to improve performance at the moment in time that it was first implemented. Even without any public pressure, this change would've been made to improve the technology. Also, that was just 1 change back then. All the public pressure for faster devices that has been present since then did not influence the decisions to implement speculative execution, because it had already been implemented. We've had it for a long time now.

2. Speculative execution only ever executes code that had the potential to be the correct code to accomplish something. In a computer, some operations are faster than others. Sometimes a program includes a branch; if this, do that. Otherwise, do something else. Speculative execution is when the processor is waiting on the answer to ""If this"" and takes a guess as to whether it will need to do ""that"" or ""something else"". If it guesses correctly (which it will find out soon), then no time was wasted and all is good. If it guesses wrong, the processor cuts its losses, throws out any changes that were made after the branch, and starts execution the right stuff.

Here, I'm talking about only a few wrong instructions. This all takes place in microseconds. Your processor isn't loading whole programs without your permission or something.",The coffee shop analogy is the best way I have yet seen to explain how this works to non-tech folks.  Excellent explanation.,"1:15 Fake News, there are no other numbers beside 1 and 0",Well I didn't know that. Thanks Vox!,"‚ÄúIt was our need for speed that got us into this mess in the first place‚Äù

Mt5C5fhuU_0,How to biohack your cells to fight cancer - Greg Foot,"Check out the science of biohacking, where biologists go into a patient‚Äôs genetic code and reprogram their immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells.

--

The human body is made up of about 30 trillion cells that carry a code which has been duplicated over and over for billions of years - with varying degrees of accuracy. So what happens when the system breaks down and the machinery turns on itself, leading to cancer? Greg Foot dives into the science of how biologists are biohacking the human body to try to fix the seemingly unfixable. 

Lesson by Greg Foot, directed by Pierangelo Pirak.

hIGtTImeYU4,What /Actually/ Happened at Chernobyl,"This video was so dang fun to research, which, of course, I feel super guilty about because, like, real people died. But, after watching the HBO miniseries, I knew there was more to the science of this. I've also heard a lot of stuff from both credible and non-credible sources that just doesn't hold up to scrutiny. The idea of the ""graphite tipped rods"" for example is just a simplification for broad audiences. But I've also heard smart folks talk about how RBMK reactors have a positive /fuel/ temperature coefficient, which is not true. No nuclear reactors do, since fuel that reacted more as it got hot would be the kind of thing that would explode every time. 

However, for a moment, because water had become such a vital part of the neutron absorption in the reactor, it did have a positive temperature coefficient...meaning that getting hotter made it hotter which made it hotter which made it hotter. That's a coefficient for the entire reactor, and it's due to the ""positive void coefficient"" where, as the water got hotter, it got less good at absorbing neutrons. 

Usually that would be more than counter-acted by the negative fuel temperature coefficient, which is why they thought it couldn't explode...but it was not in this particular circumstance.

1. Not all of the uranium in a nuclear bomb...fizzes...actually only pretty small amount does before the core blows up and the atoms get too far apart. And yet...it's still a pretty big deal.

2. It's not ""fizzes."" Fission is both a noun and verb, so uranium ""fissions"" 

3. I imply in this video a little bit that you can't have a light (regular) water reactor with a negative void coefficient...you can, you just need a different fuel / moderator realtionship. There are lots of light water reactors that are much safer than RBMK designs....they tend to require more fuel enrichment. 


4. An earlier version of this video got the date wrong and said October 26th instead of April 26. I just removed that line, which is something YouTube lets you do now.

znSeL66e8qE,What if cracks in concrete could fix themselves? - Congrui Jin,"Check out our Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/teded

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-if-cracks-in-concrete-could-fix-themselves-congrui-jin

Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But it does have a weakness: it‚Äôs prone to catastrophic cracking that has immense financial and environmental impact. What if we could avoid that problem? Congrui Jin explores how to create a more resilient concrete. 

Lesson by Congrui Jin, directed by Aeon Production.

Spartacus was a slave -- one of millions taken from territories conquered by Rome to work the mines, till the fields or fight for a crowd‚Äôs entertainment. Imprisoned for deserting the Roman Army, he and other slaves fought their way free and started a rebellion. How did a slave become synonymous with freedom and courage? Fiona Radford delves into the life and legend of Spartacus.

In fact, you showed examples of how companies are pushing forward rather quickly.","That drone shot of ""Phoenix"" is actually of Philadelphia.","The reason not to be conservative about this, is that humans kill millions on the road every year.",Please make these affordable as soon as possible I'm so tired of driving myself to work,"The speaker seems to ignore that self-driving cars are not intended for sale to individuals 
but to mobility services.

GM, Waymo, Uber or Mercedes with Car2go are preparing fleets of vehicles to provide mobility in high-density city.

In America the car will still remain a status symbol and a necessity due to vaste suburban agglomerations
but  in Europe, made of medium-sized and very dense cities, these fleets will replace private cars.

It all starts with RoboBus and RoboTaxi like the pods already presented in Las Vegas.","keep in mind ""what if they're only for rich people"" is sort of a misnomer because it ignores the used car market. 
cars hang around for a very long time before entering total non-use. think like 15 years for even the most disposable cars, much longer for others.
so a proper level 4 autonomous mercedes S class might start at 100k, but it'll change hands many times over the years and get cheaper each time it does",The Domino's part where they took out the pizza is funny. Like you would put the pizza boxes in the heat bag for about a minute just to walk them out and take them out of the bag to put the pizza boxes into the car.,"Taxi business model means far fewer vehicles to provide mobility to more people.  The current vehicle fleet is immobile for between 90 & 95% of the time, parked in a driveway or parking lot.  To expect 100% utilization is unrealistic but 40 to 50% is completely doable, a 400% improvement at least.  So go ahead and make vehicles 3 or 4 times more expensive, the economics will work out.","Was it necessary to have that shot of the guy talking through video chat on your laptop?
Why not just take recording of his talking and put it directly on the screen?","Soon the self driving cars will become sentient, and they'll start driving over pedestrians for the fun of it. Rise of the machines.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zd1ByhigPU

rVh7HP_wisw,Why colleges tolerate fraternities,"Frats are... fratty. Why do colleges keep them around?

Follow Overrated on Facebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/OverratedTheShow/

In this episode of Overrated, Vox‚Äôs Phil Edwards explores the history of frats.
 
The history of fraternities has a lot of ups and downs ‚Äî and stretches all the way back to America‚Äôs founding fathers. Beyond the hazing and beer chugging, there‚Äôs a story that includes changes in higher education and even national politics.
 
So why do colleges keep fraternities on campus? The reason is a web of incentives that make fraternities allies to administrators ‚Äî despite the negatives they sometimes present.

Overrated is a series that takes a look at the things we all know ‚Äî the books, the trends, and the ideas that have become iconic ‚Äî and answers the question: ‚ÄúWhy is this so famous""?

You're welcome.,Watching this from the living room of my fraternity house seemed pretty ironic.,The perfect distraction from the crippling debt you've got yourself into by going to College/University.,I'm from the UK so fraternity's just seem like the weirdest thing,"The better question is - Why do football players go to college. 

Oh right, colleges need money from games that have nothing to do with education.","A fraternity, like any organization, is only as good as its members and its culture. Some ""frats"" are comprised of toxic men that binge drink and haze, others are comprised of student leaders. I had a really positive experience in my college fraternity, but I understand that's not the case for everyone. Like most issues, there is a lot of nuance that can't be covered in 10 minutes.",Sounds like someone at vox didn‚Äôt get a bid :(,"I joined Pi Kap my first semester on an actual college campus. Arguably the best decision of my life; we have an actual philanthropy that we cater to, have had the highest GPA on campus at 3.1 (2.7 is the minimum for PKP), and I was never hazed going through the initiation process.

Moar giant cats!,"Wait, so are Schr√∂dinger's cats dead and he is bringing them back to life, or are they alive and he is just mutating them with radiation...




IDK I guess it's both","These are fun because it‚Äôs just math and a bit of working backwards.

You can only use the root button on perfect squares: 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 but no others because the rest go above 60. We need a 2 to start. Since it‚Äôs not possible to add 5 and/or 7 to get to 2, it must have been from the square 4. Same with 4 and 16. We would only be able to get to 16 if we had a six. Well we can make a six with 36. Since 5+7=12, if we do that 3 times we‚Äôll get there.
0 +5, +7, +5, +7, +5, +7, ‚àö, +5, +5, ‚àö, ‚àö = 2
We can‚Äôt just add to get to 10, we need another square. We can‚Äôt use 25 because 5 has already been used. So then we use 9. To get there is easy.
2 + 7, ‚àö, +7 = 10
Now all that‚Äôs left is 14. No adding once again and there‚Äôs only one more square: 49.

10 is divisible by 5 and 49 is divisible by 7 so if we reach the common multiple of 35, we switch from +5 to +7.

10 +5, +5, +5, +5, +5, +7, +7, ‚àö, +7 = 14
All done.

As for the bonus one, we can work backwards too.

25
We couldn‚Äôt have gotten to 25 by x2 so the last step must have been -3

Step 1: 28
28 can be gotten from x2 or -3 as with all evens
Step 2: 14 or 31
14 produces 2 paths while 31 makes 1
Step 3: 7, 17, or 34
Step 4: 10, 20, 17, or 37
Step 5: 5, 13, 10, 40
We already have had a 10 sooner so that path is obviously wrong 
Step 6: 8, 16, 20, 43
Step 7: 11, 4, 8, 19, 10, 23, 46
We hit 11 through one path in seven steps. By reversing the pattern, it‚Äôs:
-3, -3, x2, -3, x2, x2, -3","11 -3 -3 = 5
5√ó2 = 10
10-3=7
7x2 = 14
14x2 =28
28-3 = 25

7 moves is fewest? 2019 anyone?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeMVoJKn1Tg
xpYq54DCH2Q,This Smartwatch Might Be Samsung's Best Wearable Yet - Power Up,"The Samsung Galaxy Watch may resemble a traditional timepiece, but what lies inside is anything but traditional. The new smartwatch doubles down on trackers for sleep, fitness and stress, while keeping old Samsung Watch favorites like the interactive, rotating bezel. There are still some kinks to work out, but if you're not too particular about your apps, then this watch might be the perfect fit. Power Up's Alix Aspe has all the details on the latest wearable from Samsung.

Not in depth as the verge,"Still, don't own a smartwatch but think leaning towards to apple watch although Samsung's traditional design looks interesting.",Doesn't count steps accurately,"I like her! Nice watch, too!....",I like the fact that you can put almost any band on it to customize. Most people see my Samsung watch and is amazed when they find out it's not a traditional watch. I like that. The downfall and dealbreaker for me in upgrading to the 2018 is the fact no more SamsungPay on it. Love the fact I can literally leave my phone at home and pay with my watch.,"I got this watch, it's garbage. Had to send it back 4 times because it wouldn't hold its charge after a product updates.  BTW stay away from the IconX that is serious garbage as well. Best phones in the world though.",Like watching a middle schooler read their rushed paper they did for home work.,milli-meter not mil-im-eter,I own the Samsung Galaxy watch and the review is accurate.

2QJ2L2ip32w,Can you solve the stolen rubies riddle? - Dennis Shasha,"Practice more problem-solving at https://brilliant.org/TedEd/
Solution to Bonus Riddle: https://brilliant.org/TedEdRuby/

Townspeople are demanding that a corrupt merchant‚Äôs collection of 30 rubies be confiscated to reimburse the victims of his schemes. The king announces that the fine will be determined through a game of wits between the merchant and the king‚Äôs most clever advisor ‚Äì you. Can you outfox the merchant and win back the greatest amount of rubies to help his victims? Dennis Shasha shows how.

*We're screwed*","Just yell ""Bah! Humbug!"" and confiscate his rubies instead. There's no need to compromise with a scoundrel.","Bonus riddle: The maximum amount of rubies you can have is 10, as putting any more in a pile will result in the opponent taking it",I‚Äôll feel really smart whenever I solve a riddle but realise its not that big of a deal,"For a second I thought the solution was wrong because in the merchant‚Äôs shoes, I‚Äôd have done 2-8-20, except that combo still gives you 16 gems by the proposed 8-8-8 method. And if you got lucky enough to hit the 8-8-14 scenario, that‚Äôs 24 gems for you. So good riddle, but perhaps the logic behind the solution could be explained better by showing more distribution patterns going through 8-8-8?",This is most definitely not a just and fair method of determining the punishment for any criminal. The real scoundrel in this story is the king.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QJ2L2ip32w

GVNy3x_PwFk,Three Colors - Blue: Crash Course Film Criticism #11,"Movies are really good at making us feel. Happy, sad, excited, etc... Part of that is because they use so many different types of media all at once. Photography, music, performance, and editing all play into their ability to communicate ideas and make us feel emotions. And Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Three Colors: Blue"" is a master class this.

I love you guys and you have saved me on many tests. But I‚Äôd love a series on music theory. It‚Äôs so complex but and I love a comprehensive course in your easy to understand style,"I was obsessed with the Trois Couleurs  trilogy when they were coming out. One thing that I remember being a big discussion at the time but Michael doesn't mention at all is the implication in the film that Julie was Patrice's unacknowledged collaborator, with him accepting the plaudits for work they did together. Weirdly, in the shooting script it's explicitly stated that the symphony was solely Patrice's work, so Kieslowski seemingly deliberately removed that to keep it ambiguous.

Anyway, it's not super relevant to Michael's reading‚Äî more like a subplot‚Äî but it's interesting.

You guys keep doing films I love! Can't wait for The Eagle Huntress!","Blue is my favorite of the three, and one of my favorite movies in general. Great to see a video on it. üòä
Kieslowsky doesn't get nearly enough love and attention on the internet as he deserves!","I think that Blue is about Liberty. From my reading of the film, she was the brilliant musician and her husband took all the credit. When he died she could not take back her music from a dead man. In addition the discovery that he had betrayed her for another women makes her want to be independent again.","Brilliant episode about a brilliant movie.

It's worth paying attention to all the fades to black in _Blue_ too: they're not used as they usually are in movies, to signal a passage of time or a change of place. Here Kieslowski fades to black and comes back to the exact same place, same time, as if this was just a deep breath or a moment of private introspection. Extremely well done.",Lorne!! Lorne is such and underrated character in the Buffyverse and I'm glad to see him being mentioned here.,"Just watched this a week ago in my foreign film class, we recently started White, and we'll be watching Red after!","I dunno why but I really want you people to do one on ""And Justice for All"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" !

mtHilmUa69M,To the Lighthouse: Crash Course Literature #408,"John Green teaches you about Virginia Woolf's modernist novel, To the Lighthouse. Let's face it. You're not reading To the Lighthouse for the plot. There's not a whole lot of plot, unless you count the tension about the beef stew. You're reading it because it's a pioneering literary work that explores point of view, narrative flow, and the nature of art, among other things. You're going to love it. I mean, part of the story is told from the perspective of a house.

The truth of this statement made it stand out to me.","""Some people talk about visiting a lighthouse. They don't. Then they do.""

Well that was a short video.","I love that I never walk away from a Crash Course Lit video feeling like I haven't learned something. I don't mean purely academically, either. Even when I'm already familiar with the subject matter, I don't think I've ever left one of these videos without feeling at least a little bit humbled, or deeply touched in a new way that's difficult to describe. Keep up the good work.",Please extend this to dramas too!!! I want to see a video on Waiting For Godot.,"What I think people don't seem to grasp about this novel, and about modernist literature in general, is that modernist literature is the closet literature that comes to being ""true"" or ""real."" So, when people always say ""oh modernist novels are boring,"" if you ask them why, they'll say something like ""nothing happens in the text."" Yet, the situations that are presented in the text, are presenting in real life. Think about this for a second, what exactly ""happens"" in our lives that isn't mundane or ""boring?"" The answer is that our lives are exactly that. We may visit foreign countries, go sky diving, but we are always brought back to this mundane life. But, it is what happens in these mundane instances that is so thrilling. Why? Because it gives us a chance to muse. It forces us to think, and thinking is something that modern society has swayed away from, especially with the rise of technology. While modernist literature may be exhausting to read and consume, it is this indigestion that makes the reading the text more palpable. In other words, there is a certain joy of reading a difficult modernist text that simply doesn't come with other text.","I'm really happy that CC has made a video about Virginia Woolf. A great writer, sometimes forgotten as a novelist because A Room for One's Own sells better. Love her work <3",Kinda felt that Lily had more than simply admiration for Ms.Ramsay and her cheerfulness/nourishment. Especially when she remembers her after finishing the painting.

rwAyoX8D3YE,When the only way to go free is to plead guilty,"A confounding case in Baltimore shows just how far prosecutors will go to keep a win on the books. 

Check out ProPublica‚Äôs feature story on the use of the Alford plea here: https://www.propublica.org/article/what-does-an-innocent-man-have-to-do-alford-plea-guilty

In 1987 police detectives ‚Äî who‚Äôd later be made famous by David Simon, creator of ‚ÄúThe Wire‚Äù ‚Äî ¬†used flimsy evidence to pin a burglary, rape and murder case on James Thompson and James Owens. They were both sentenced to life in prison. Then 20 years later, DNA evidence cleared each of them of the rape and unraveled the state‚Äôs theory of the crime. But instead of exonerating the two men, prosecutors dangled the prison keys, pushing them to plead guilty to the crime in exchange for immediate freedom. What prosecutors offered was a controversial deal called an Alford plea. Last year, ProPublica investigated prosecutors‚Äô use of Alford pleas and similar deals in cases of wrongful convictions, and found they often cover up official misconduct. Check out the story of the two Jameses above to see what happened after the Alford plea was offered in their cases.

Ectogenesis is transforming reproductive rights

Ectogenesis ‚Äì the growth of mammalian embryos in artificial environments ‚Äì was first described in 1924 by British scientist J.B.S. Haldane. His essay, Daedalus; or, Science and the Future, was regarded as shocking science fiction at the time, but later proved to be remarkable in having predicted many scientific advances. Haldane was a friend of author Aldous Huxley, whose famous novel Brave New World (1932) anticipated similar developments in reproductive technology.

In 1953, a transient biochemical pregnancy was reported by Australian researchers who extracted an intact fertilised egg. It was followed by in vitro fertilisation (IVF) six years later enabling the birth of a live rabbit. The first human pregnancy through IVF occurred in 1973 ‚Äì though it only lasted for a few days. A major milestone was finally reached in 1978, when Louise Brown became the first ""test tube baby"" having been conceived on a petri dish.

During the 1980s, IVF was condemned as immoral by religious groups, but public opinion shifted in favour of these procedures. The next few decades saw rapid development in the field. New drugs, better ovarian stimulation techniques, and improved ways to identify the best embryos, all helped in achieving higher success rates, while costs were lowered. The ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos also greatly improved the feasibility of IVF. By the dawn of the 21st century, it had become a mainstream medical technology. Half a million test tube babies had been born around the world by 2004 and this number increased ten-fold to reach five million by 2012.

Other developments in reproductive medicine included the first baby born to a mother with a womb transplant, reported in 2014.* Three-parent babies became possible in 2016. An even more ambitious and challenging goal lay ahead. It was almost a century since Haldane coined the term ""ectogenesis"" and replacing traditional pregnancies with fully artificial wombs had now become a real possibility. A number of hurdles remained ‚Äì including ethical and legal considerations ‚Äì but genuine progress was being made. One study introduced a mouse embryo into a lab-created uterine lining, resulting in successful implantation and growth on these engineered tissues ‚Äì held on a bio-engineered, extra-uterine ""scaffold."" In another study, goat foetuses survived for ten days in a prototype artificial womb consisting of a machine with amniotic fluid in tanks. A third study achieved this with a human embryo, but regulations allowed only a 14-day timespan on research of this kind. These and other breakthroughs led to the first complete working animal wombs in the early 2020s.*

A further decade of pioneering work, alongside a relaxing of regulations, led to a human version in the early 2030s.** This first model demonstrated an ability to supply both oxygen and nutrients from an external source to nurture a foetus, as well as dispose of waste material. The feed incorporated an interface to function as a placenta. During clinical trials, it was made available to a small number of parents, but quickly became widespread in the decade after its introduction.*

With mainstream use having been achieved, rapid changes began to occur in society. Ectogenesis offered a new way of producing children without having to endure a lengthy, painful and potentially dangerous pregnancy cycle. Women no longer had the sole responsibility of childbirth and were free from worries about whether a certain lifestyle or environment (such as alcohol consumption) was harming the foetuses' development. Every aspect of the nine-month process could be monitored in perfect detail by the machines ‚Äì ensuring a safe and efficient alternative to natural birth. For many women, their lifestyle and career prospects were transformed; a boon for gender equality. Those with damaged, diseased or removed uteri could also take advantage of the procedure. Homosexual couples and single men could also have children without having to use surrogate mothers. Yet another option now available was for pregnant women seeking an abortion to place their embryo in these artificial wombs, allowing somebody else to adopt it rather than killing off the foetus.

Many conservatives and religious groups remained opposed to this process, just as they had been for IVF ‚Äì but the influence of religion was declining as the world continued to become more secular. Feminists were divided over this new definition of ""motherhood"" and its effect on their role in society. Meanwhile some expressed concerns that children born in this way could lack an essential bond with their mothers that other children had. However, these machines were able to use vocal recordings, movement, and other sensations to accurately simulate a natural gestation. Even greater advances would emerge in the 2050s with extensive manipulation of DNA in these wombs allowing ""designer babies"" for the rich.*",Not going to mention that the scientist is from Israel?,i need memes in youtube comments rn,so an entire heart huh,Now transplant it into a women and see what happens when they have feelings.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg6XxrHCY60

Cannabidiol is having a moment. Increasingly common state legalization and loose federal regulation means that anyone in any state can go online or to a physical store and buy CBD products ‚Äî from oils to dog treats to bath bombs ‚Äî without fear of arrest. It‚Äôs been shown to help treat a number of conditions including psychosis, anxiety, movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy and seizures. For years, people have used medical marijuana to address those conditions ‚Äî but CBD is showing promise as a possible way to get the benefits of medical cannabis without getting high. 

Here‚Äôs the catch: Most of the CBD products that have trickled down to the consumer market are poorly labeled and have extremely low doses. Granted, it‚Äôs possible that the placebo effect is providing CBD users with tangible benefits. And it‚Äôs also possible that low-dose CBD products can act as a form of microdosing, where users take small amounts of a substance to achieve milder or entirely different results than a full dose. 

CBD isn‚Äôt a scam. It‚Äôs a powerful substance with a lot of medical potential. But most of the stuff on the market now probably isn‚Äôt worth your time.

HO-qcThRCss,The 10 Biggest Airline Failures In The Past Decade,"Flying can be scary but airplanes and airlines have been improving over the past decade. The focus tends to go to the failures but when you look at statistics, flying is actually safer than driving a car!

You're safer up in the air than you are driving along the road. Sure, the latest things you see on the news might not suggest as much, but hear us out. But no matter how many times we're reassured that the chances of something bad happening are less than one in a million, we can't help but fixate on the things that do happen. So today, we'll be showing you some of the biggest airline failures that have taken place in the last decade. 

So in actual fact, these events might have happened, but the odds of them doing so were infinitely small.

xD",You talk 737 but show pics of 787...not very credible.,The Boeing 737 is safe. The 737 MAX 8 has had some technical issues. Those planes have been grounded and will not be put in use until the FAA re-certifies them for safety.,"1:06 I can remember the following:

 


The type of plane i was on.
The Airline.
The seat.
The comfort.
The flight number.
The registration Number of the flight.
And the flight path.",I was just watching 10 sharks you don‚Äôt want come across,"1:37 that is not a boeing 737 Max 8, its a 787-8.

As someone who has, in the past year:

- had a signed publishing contract unexpectedly cancelled;
- been told one day I was being promoted to a higher position at a global media company, then told the next that I was being let go because that position no longer existed;
- gotten in a debilitating car wreck when I was rear ended on the Los Angeles freeway, leaving me with months of mind-cracking chronic pain;
- watched my savings dwindle in pursuit of my dreams until tumbleweeds whistled through my bank account;
- been guaranteed a screenwriting job for the president of a major studio, only to have the project (for now) disappear...

...I needed this.

It‚Äôs been a while since we talked, and longer still since we last hung out, but despite the time and distance I still feel like you often have a knack for swooping in at the vital moment to be my fairy godbrother.

Wishing you and the family hope, happiness, and health, my friend.

I was still going to study for it now but deep down, I started believing that I am not going to make it. And so I was not giving my all, setting myself up for failure. I have tears in my eyes now.

We are all born unique. Each and every one of us has some sort of special trait that makes us stand out from the rest. Whether it‚Äôs because of a unique hair color, a special body part, or an amazing talent, there are no two people alike. That is, unless you‚Äôre an identical twin or something. That‚Äôs a different story. Yet, there are some people out there who are larger than life in ways that you wouldn‚Äôt even think of. Some people were born with things like the longest legs, longest tongue, largest hips, and more. Luckily, we are evolving as a society and are becoming more accepting of unique and huge body features. Should this have come out 50 years ago, you would find that these people would have been ostracized, if not even cast out from society. Today, we can appreciate those who are different from us, if not even celebrate their differences thanks to the internet!

It's a bold plan ,which provides a blueprint how we can begin the process to address the real and systematic concerns of race in America. No one else has made any effort to heal this wound. This is the candidate that is offering the best solutions to rebuild our foundation. This is the generational change America needs. I will vote for Pete.",Pete Buttigieg has a well thought out plan.  Go listen to his discussion about it on another video,Newman!,"Wow, they're all so cool, and seem so smart and confident, I just can't decide who to vote for.","Go, Elizabeth Warren! GO!!!
Joe Biden IS UNELECTABLE!
It's not JUST about the 1994 Crime Bill - it's that the argument Trump and the Russians put forth against Hillary Clinton back then and Joe Biden now WAS THE TRUTH!
 Bill Clinton and Joe Biden ARE responsible for the US mass incarceration AND the prisoner slave labor issue AND the unbelievable growth of private prisons! ... and MOST OF THE VICTIMS OF OF THAT POLICY WERE BLACK MEN!

          This man is a dangerous idiot... When men like him have destroyed any real country you who choose him will know what you have lost. Not real problems don't need solutions. 
           Leftist shooter, not mentioned by news???? 
          Biden the Chinese candidate will have much more flexibility after the election. De Blasio tearing down respect for law in his own city and a liar read song...
          Vote for President Donald Trump if all of this that follows seems true. Defeat the dark forces that will not allow your practice of voting your conscience and the defeat of constitutional forces. There will be years after that to gather forces of goodwill and real change don't be their comedic tool.
          of Strzok...This should be taken into account when he enters plea in his prosecution, not repentant and a liar. Eats off liars plates, and pulls up liars pants, conjures liars thoughts and gangs up for liars rants: Drives a liars car... wears a liars shoes... swears a liars lie... reads a liars news: Faces a liars kids...kisses a liars wife...demands he is believed ...  and lives a liars life.      ( You know who you are) Might be a song....c.
         Current political situation: Drugs and profits are the real drivers of the present political situation. Why anti white, not profitable. Why anti Christian, not drug users. Why anti-middle class what ever the color, not going to be drug users work for a living.  Why no lottery for immigration on merrit, not drug users or family of drug users or gang members. Why anti fence, drug users. Why anti law enforcement, drug users or drug profits, our officers are in the highest and greatest part heros... Why gangs law breakers turned loose, pro drugs sales. Why import gangs from the south, drugs industry and profits feed political machine or promise they will. Why sanctuary cities, federal drug agencies loose connection with local agencies that might stop the flow of drug gangs and drugs. Why crash the economy with communism or any excuse, so no one can oppose the flow of drugs from the south. Why crash the economy with health care for all drug profits and addiction.  Why the desperate political language, drug addiction or addicted to drug profits. (HOW can you tell, they display all the symptoms of being strung out. How many of Antifa are addicts. Why from college campuses most dense use of drugs and sales??? a guess. only reason you need masks, you don't want you face showing up in other investigations if you are busted for illegal drugs that will identify your other friends, users, sellers)
          Illegal immigration is a hostage of drug profits. Mexico and central America is hostage of drug profits,their people are being killed. Human trafficking is hostage of the flow of drugs. Our political discourse is the hostage of those that can profit from drugs. Our news organizations are hostage to those that can profit from drugs. Why no real political solutions to these problems beside drugs, then you would be free to concentrate on drugs, why Run millions into the country to water down the governments resources that might fight against the flow of drugs and profits. ( The democrats don't want solutions they want the free flow of drugs, to your children and their grandchildren and to you babysitter and your taxi driver etc. )
          You want to see desperation double down on drug interdiction. Build the fence and Give politic back to the American people and not opinions of those that are not citizens. Build the fence and Give Mexico back to the Good people of Mexico. Stabilize the politics of central and South America, build the fence and double down on drug interdiction and pay governments south of Us To do the same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7IfeUxMCk0

ItWweMVi41s,The voices of children separated at the border,"Over 2,300 children have been separated from their families.

Read ProPublica reporter Ginger Thompson‚Äôs article here: https://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-trump-immigration-policy

And listen to the full audio clip at ProPublica‚Äôs YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoncXfYBAVI&t=70s 

In April 2018, the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions instituted a ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy on undocumented immigration. Undocumented migrants and asylum seekers detained at the border now face immediate criminal prosecution, often before their asylum claims can even be processed. Thousands of children and other migrants are now being held in detention centers operated by US Customs and Border Protection, where they await trial.

A backlash against this policy is growing, with conservatives and liberals alike decrying it as cruel and inhumane. Both the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Sessions have explicitly cited the policy as a preemptive deterrent to undocumented migration, though the administration has since backtracked on that message. 

We want to help shed light on this. Has your family been separated at the US‚ÄìMexico border? Are you a worker at a detention center, or do you aid families who have been affected? Tell us more at border@propublica.org or 347-244-2134.

In our Vox+ProPublica collaboration, we create deep-dive, investigative video storytelling fueled by ProPublica's reporting. You can read the reporting at https://www.propublica.org, and watch the rest of the series on YouTube at http://bit.ly/2wfVG5Z.

ObKE1m3EmdE,Thomas Edison's road trip with his famous friends,"It‚Äôs time to go road-tripping with some men who ran the world.

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

This is episode one of Vox Almanac‚Äôs new season all about roads ‚Äî and this is a classic road trip to kick it off with. 

Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone, and John Burroughs became famous as ‚Äúthe Vagabonds‚Äù ‚Äî a traveling group that took to the (primitive) roads to see the country and make the occasional business deal. Their exploits captured the imagination of the entire country, and it even involved a few naps.

Along the way, the unique foursome chopped trees, explored, and ate in style (while catering to the film crew they brought with them). The resulting output was a mix of PR and good old-fashioned fun. Even President Warren G. Harding joined along at one point just to see what the Vagabonds were up to.

UI4g_amOTSg,What a new Supreme Court means for abortion,"States can ‚Äî and are ‚Äî limiting access to abortion. In some parts of America, it is essentially unavailable.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Abortion has been a subject of debate for decades, and now, President Trump is poised to tip the balance of the Supreme Court into one that could reverse the historic decision that established a woman‚Äôs right to choose: Roe v. Wade.

The case of Roe v. Wade is a frequently a stand-in when we talk about abortion rights, and Trump would be fulfilling a campaign promise by appointed judges that could, in theory, overturn the decision.

But although the landmark 1973 ruling made abortion legal ‚Äî in fact, a guaranteed constitutional right governed under the right to privacy ‚Äî states have limited powers to regulate the practice. And they have been given more and more authority to add restrictions and regulations that limit that right to a smaller number of individuals.

There are 1,193 state-level restrictions on abortion, and for some women, it has functionally made abortion inaccessible. And if the Court does overturn Roe v. Wade, some states already have laws that would automatically ban some or all abortion. But many American women already live as if that were the case.

Child support isn't always a given so you've got to provide a program to help them, especially until the child is 18. If abortion becomes illegal, those programs should definitely be expanded to deal with the influx.","Abortion is a difficult topic for me...
On one hand, I support it because it kills children, on the other, I don't because it gives woman a choice",Read this as abduction at first and was excited the court was finally looking into the alien probing cases across Nevada but this is important too I guess.  Keep asking questions.,Its not called Supreme Court its called S U P R E M E court $90000000 fine fam,Coat hanger sales go up 500%,"We need more sex education. As a pro lifer, we do need more than abstinence only sex Ed. Tell them how to protect themselves explicitly. Hopefully we can agree on this at least","First stop attacking sex ed. Education is important so you know the responsibility and avoid making 'mistake'.
Second stop attacking birth control. This can prevent unwanted pregnancy thus abortion in the first place.
Third stop lying to the patient. Don't act and dress up like you're an expert when you're not. We literally have people going around lying to people about abortion and hurting the mother because they're given false information.

""There are no noise-cancelling headphones to stop the U.S. Navy‚Äôs 235-decibel pressure waves of unbearable pinging and metallic shrieking. At 200 Db, the vibrations can rupture your lungs, and above 210 Db, the lethal noise can bore straight through your brain until it hemorrhages that delicate tissue. If you‚Äôre not deaf after this devastating sonar blast, you‚Äôre dead."" ... HOW¬¥S YOUR HEARING? ... I SAID... cute hair-do.

The Pixel 3 and 3 XL both have a much higher quality look and feel with a glass front and back. Both feature larger screens than last year‚Äôs models thanks to slimmed down bezels ‚Äî and the controversial notch in the case of the bigger phone. The camera quality also seems great and call screening is as good as advertised. For the first time, the phones will support wireless charging Google is introducing its own charging stand as an optional accessory.

805rnyxeFD0,Husband Discovers Wife Was Really a Man After 19 Years of Marriage,"There are a number of things that are essential in making a marriage work. It starts with love, but you need more. Respect, friendship, loyalty, and honesty are also very important. Most people get to know one another well before getting married. This allows them to really get to know each other. Most deep, dark secrets come out before the couple has a chance to say, ""I do."" 

Most people agree that telling a white lie to your spouse occasionally is forgivable. This is especially true if you are lying to spare your spouse's feelings. While white lies are forgivable, major, life-changing lies can destroy a marriage. 

There are some lies that are so serious and so damaging, that they can end a marriage. Lying about being faithful to your spouse and lying about spending and finances are not uncommon. These lies can be forgivable, but in many cases, they aren't. Lying about your gender is almost always a deal breaker. This is what happened to a man in Belgium. A husband discovers wife was really a man after 19 years of marriage and it turns his whole life upside down. 

Jan is a 64-year-old Belgian man. In 1993, he married his Indonesian wife, Monica. He wanted them to start their new live in Belgium and started making the necessary arrangements and processing the necessary documents. When it came time to settle Monica's paperwork, things became difficult. The Belgian courts doubted the authenticity of Monica's identification. In time, despite the doubts about her identity, they approved her application. The family was going to be allowed to start their lives in Belgium. 

For several years, the couple lived a normal life. Monica, who was now 48-years-old, was like a big sister to Jan's two children from his previous marriage. Since Jan already had two children, the couple decided that they wouldn't have anymore. Things were good for quite a while. 

After almost two decades of being married, Monica started to change. She got a new full-time job, and suddenly, she was wearing very short skirts, flashy clothes, and tiny tops. She often wore shirts that showed off her whole abdomen. She also started going to nightclubs. She often ran into her stepson while she was out dancing. Monica also started talking to other men on the computer and Jan saw them on the computer. He was also hearing rumors of her cheating. He confronted her, and they got into a heated argument. Soon, someone called the police. 

When all of this was going on, a friend of Jan's told him that he heard a rumor that Monica was actually a sex-changed man. His son had heard the same rumors. Jan pushed his wife against the wall and told her to tell him the truth. She admitted that she was born a boy and had a sex change. Since she was a woman, she didn't think that she had to tell him about her past. This was when his world collapsed. They started to fight, and the police were called again. 

According to Jan, there were no signs that his wife was once a man. He says that during sex, everything seemed normal. She even bought sanitary napkins every month to keep up the appearance that she was menstruating as a normal woman would. When Jan saw her doing this, he had no reason to doubt that she was a woman. He had no idea that she was doing it all for appearance sake. 

Jan knew that there was no way that he could stay with Monica and he filed for an annulment. He hired a lawyer who released a statement saying, ""that person has deliberately deceived him for years, even scammed.  Presumably, she has also forged documents used her to get a residence permit. The children, who for years have lived with her, are devastated."" Although they are in the process of ending their marriage, the Belgian courts refused to allow Jan to evict Monica. 

Because of Monica's lies and deception, Jan needs help. He is undergoing psychiatric treatment to help him deal with the shocking revelation. For close to two decades, this man thought that his wife was a woman. When he learned that she had lied, her entire world fell apart. For the first time in close to 20 years, he doesn't have a wife. His life partner turned out to be a man and kept it a secret. This is one of the biggest secrets that a person could ever keep. Most people, including Jan, wouldn't be able to forgive such a thing.

Throughout his career as a drug trafficker, tunnels have been the common theme in El Chapo‚Äôs story. When he gained control of a major drug trafficking corridor in the late 1980s, Joaquin Guzman Loera ‚Äî then known as ‚Äúel Rapido‚Äù‚Äî was the first to create super tunnels for transporting drugs across the border.

At the time, a crackdown by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) meant Colombian cocaine was in decline and the Mexican narcotrafficker saw an opportunity. By using tunnels to facilitate fast transport, El Chapo leveraged his role as a trafficker to claim new responsibilities as a cultivator and distributor of drugs. 

Over the next twenty years, he learned how to use his drug tunnels in ways nobody had ever imagined and his success became dependent on his subterranean inclinations. Although his masterful use of tunnels led him to a maximum security jail cell at Altiplano prison, it would be tunnels that also led him back out again.

Subscribe for more! ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest ‚óÑ
 
Cristiano Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the most successful soccer players in the world‚Äîand for good reason. When he‚Äôs not chasing after the ball, he‚Äôs kicking it right down the other end of the field to score yet another goal for his team. He‚Äôs the kind of soccer player that everyone wishes was on their team, and he‚Äôs not afraid to take risks to succeed on the field. But there‚Äôs far more to Cristiano than meets the eye, and some of his other habits seem almost ridiculous when you compare them to his chosen career path. For starters, he‚Äôs donated millions of dollars to charity. He had a childhood illness that could've put an end to his soccer career early on. But we bet that you won't even believe us when we tell you what Cristiano does as a side hustle.

Correction at 7:48: The protester says ‚ÄúThey are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.‚Äù

Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong‚Äôs Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China‚Äôs flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city‚Äôs judicial independence.

At first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would ‚Äúindefinitely suspend‚Äù the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam‚Äôs resignation.

But this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong‚Äôs relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China‚Äôs favor.

Watch this video to understand the news coming out of Hong Kong and the history that led up to this moment.¬†

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

√âtienne-Jules Marey was a French scientist and inventor who analyzed how things moved. He developed a way to photograph multiple stages of movement onto a single glass plate, a technique called chronophotography. Later, when Kodak introduced celluloid film, Marey swapped the glass plate for a roll of film that moved in between exposures. This technique formed the basis of cinematography, and it‚Äôs how he recorded the stages of a cat righting itself in midair. He published his findings in Nature and demonstrated how the cat splits its body in two and uses the inertia of its own body weight to spin around.

Trump has made questions about his mental fitness unavoidable, with nearly every major news network now openly discussing whether the president has the the cognitive stability to do his job. But psychiatrists and mental health experts have been largely absent in the debate about Trump‚Äôs mental health. That‚Äôs thanks to the Goldwater Rule, a decades-old ethical guideline that‚Äôs coming under serious pressure as Trump starts his second year in office.

Athletes are a more subversive breed of celebrity. Their chief concern is not beauty, fame, or even money; it‚Äôs success within a respective sport. Though some certainly fall victim to the intoxicating gaze of the public eye, bent on fulfilling its every desire, many are unconcerned or even uncomfortable with the spotlight. Sure, there are egos, but the egos are their own and not manufactured by a publicity department. The best athletes have the autonomy that other public figures lack. Do you think Mike Tyson cares how he‚Äôs viewed by the media? Absolutely not. His value was onefold: boxing. He knew it and the people with money knew it. That‚Äôs the source of his power. Your approval is meaningless to Mike Tyson, and this is an ideal adopted by sports giants of comparable greatness. Letting oneself go is not surrendering dignity, it‚Äôs the declaration of freedom from the all-judging eye. For every athlete that takes this position, however, there‚Äôs one who does the opposite, sacrificing one‚Äôs inner and outer self for prolonged relevancy. This never works, and often leaves the athlete worse than before. Whichever of these positions an athlete takes, their appearance tends to change drastically once the career ends and the spotlight dims. We just hope it‚Äôs on their terms.

-aV6aMgzldI,6 Famous People Who Lost All Their Money And Went Broke,"These celebrities went from richest to rags! Subscribe to TheRichest for more amazing videos! ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest ‚óÑ

Even if someone is rich and famous right now, that doesn't mean that they'll be rich and famous forever. The popularity of a person comes and goes, and it's not a rare occurrence for celebrities to slip into obscurity. Even if they're still as famous as ever, that doesn't mean that they're as rich as you assume them to be. The problem with money is that the more you have of it, the more you have to spend. Some celebrities get so caught up in buying luxuries that they accidentally blow through hundreds of millions of dollars. When this happens, they declare bankruptcy. That's what happened to Mike Tyson and 50 Cent, who both confused the entire world when they declared that they were broke. Other celebrities, like Johnny Depp, Michael Jackson, and Lindsay Lohan, never got to the point of bankruptcy, but were cash poor for years. But you'll have to keep watching until the very end to see how Kanye West claims he put himself into debt.

I think he just doesn't know how to break it to us yet, and his frequent breaks are preparing us for it... The sad thing is, I know that many people including myself only buy smile more items because it's associated with him.

mICxKmCjF-4,Admit it. Republicans have broken politics.,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they‚Äôre making it impossible for Congress to work the way it‚Äôs supposed to.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists‚Äô call ‚Äúasymmetrical polarization.‚Äù

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they‚Äôve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that‚Äôs made it really easy for media outlets to blame ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Even Worse Than It Looks,‚Äù journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they‚Äôre not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who‚Äôs responsible for breaking our politics.

-kTWIm7m4Uw,We Bought A House,"This house means the world to us.  The absolute world.  I also realize now that this is my 400th video which is pretty cool as well and totally isn't gonna make me cry or anything.  Also just a clarification about when we are talking about not contributing to the online culture of flaunting your belongings, that's not shade at people.  I'm proud for people that do that and I think it's wonderful for them, I love to watch them and I think it's really cool when people are genuine about it because they deserve whatever they want to spend their money on, I just don't have that in me which was what I was trying to express.  Like I said I have some ""nice things"" guilt which is why I don't have a lot of nice things lol, not because I don't think they're nice I just feel weird having nice things, a nice house included.  IDK OKAY ITS COMPLICATED.  But this house is so important to us, it's our freedom and future and we just couldn't be happier so thank you for always supporting us in whatever stupid stuff we decide to do and make.  It's been a long journey for me personally to get here, I know a lot of you have been here for years and I just want to say thank you.  I'm getting very emotional now so I'm just gonna stuff those feelings down and pretend they aren't happening lol.  I'm looking forward to ruining my future kitchen table with acrylic nail supplies etc. because the salon will live on know what I'm sayin.  Anyways though, we are incredibly happy, and the next time you see us we will be in our new home.

HcSwesDrUGE,Man Sick of Neighborhood Children on His Lawn Takes Things Too Far,"Most people care as much about the way the outside of their house looks as they do the inside. Because of this, many homeowners take excellent care of their lawns, making sure that they are perfectly manicured. The last thing that a homeowner wants is for people to go traipsing through their yard leaving a path of trash behind them. Bryan Tucker is one of these people. He took great pride in his lawn, and he wanted it to look perfect. 

Although Bryan was a relatively young guy, he was starting to remind himself of a cranky old man. Every morning, he would yell at the local children to stay off of his lawn. Bryan's yard was right behind a bus stop. Every morning, he could hear the kids playing loudly. He knew that there was nothing that he could do to keep the noise down. Since he was already up at that time of the morning, the noise didn't bother him. It was the kids running on his lawn and leaving trash in the yard that bothered him the most. 

Bryan says that the kids don't respect other people's land. He called the county to see what could be done about the problem. Unfortunately, they told him that there was nothing that they could do to help him. They told him that it was his responsibility to keep the children out of his yard. Frustrated, Bryan tried to figure out what he could do to keep the kids from destroying his yard. 

The first thing that Bryan did was hang ""No Trespassing"" signs on the trees in his yard. He figured that if the kids saw the signs, that they would stay on the sidewalk. Next, he installed cameras in the yard. He hoped that if the children saw the cameras, they would know that he was watching and they would stay out of his lawn. When neither of these things worked, he asked the parents to keep their children out of the yard. He even asked the kids. Unfortunately, nothing was working. The kids were still playing in his yard and leaving trash behind. 

When school let out for the summer, Bryan's problems came to an end. His grass was looking better than ever, and he didn't need to worry about picking up trash every day. As the school year got closer, Bryan knew that he had to take extreme steps if he was going to keep the kids off his lawn. Since none of his tactics had worked the previous school year, he decided to try something different. 

On the first day of school, the parents in the neighborhood took their kids to the bus stop. When they got there, they saw that there was a new addition. Bryan had installed a fence around his home. When one of the parents touched the fence, he felt a shock. His hands were shaking when he let go of the fence, and all of the parents realized that it was an electric fence. Man sick of neighborhood children on his lawn takes things too far. 

When the other parents got to the bus stop, they couldn't believe that Bryan had installed an electric fence around his home. They were outraged. One parent, Wayne Milby, was angry that Bryan didn't put up a sign. Right after, Bryan showed the parents that there was a sign. It was about 15 yards away from the bus stop. The sign was on the battery pack that powered the fence. It read, ""Solar Intellishock"" and there was a picture of a cow on it. 

Many of the parents couldn't understand why Bryan couldn't install a regular fence. Why did he need an electric fence? Many parents wondered what message the fence was sending their children. Since he did this on the first day of school, many parents were angry enough to call the county. 

The same day, the Henrico County Public Works Director, Steve Yob, came out to Bryan's home. They were going to inspect the fence and measure the yard. If the fence was on Bryan's property, there was nothing that they could do. When they took the measurements, they found that Bryan put the fence on land that wasn't all his. This meant that he had to take the fence down. When he got the news, it took it down without any arguments. 

Bryan took down his fence and was happy that it served its purpose. He wanted to make some noise. He wanted the parents to see that he was serious about keeping the kids off the yard. He wanted them to understand that it was up to them to keep their children off his property and act like good citizens. Some of the parents thought that Bryan should have done what the previous owner did by putting out a garbage can for the kids' trash. Many people agreed with Bryan. It isn't his responsibility to put a basket out for the kids. They should be taught that littering and trespassing are wrong. Bryan hasn't said whether or not he will put the fence back up on his property. He is just glad that the conversation started.",2019-05-18T18:00:01.000Z,39633.0,1112.0,55.0,296,I agree with Brian. He went through every avenue before making a choice to take matters into his own hands.  He even talked to the parents. So I believe he wasn't in the wrong for doing what he did,I think the kids should have got a fine for littering everybody else would get one!,Great job Sir.!  Kids today have no respect.. Because parents don't.,I would put it back up on my property and say screw em.,"The parents deserved the electronic shock !!
County couldn't help him, but they busted his ass when the unfit parents who didn't hang with their brats til the bus came and had no control..
Awesome remedy...!!
Zap the brat back...!
Lol...","the fence goes back up, on owner's property, the signs go up, the juice goes back on, and maybe, just maybe, those 'parents' will teach their little, disrespectful crotch droppings some civility and rules of common decency.  from the latest crop of disrespectful failures in the public school systems, i wouldn't hold my breath.",I think we need our kids need to respect others even some grown-ups need to learn to,Lol I'm from South Africa cape town every house must have a boundary wall with electric fence.,Absolutely love the guy's response to each of the issues. Nobody helped him so he decided to shock some sense into people. Sometimes crossing the line is the only way to get your point across.,"I don't blame the guy for putting up the electric fence. Next time, be sure the fence is on your property, not someone else's üòâüòâüòâ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcSwesDrUGE

U9wY8Wz6lCs,Why this Gucci knockoff is totally legal,"Knockoffs are everywhere in fashion. So is the controversy they inspire. 

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Allbirds says Steve Madden copied their sneakers. Gucci says Forever 21 ripped off their green-red-green stripes. Adidas says Zara knocked off their Yeezys. 

In the Constitution, Congress has the power to stop copying by giving authors and inventors ‚Äúthe exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.‚Äù 

But there‚Äôs a catch. These protections must ‚Äúpromote the progress‚Äù of creative industries. 

Conventional wisdom holds that copying kills innovation and hurts industry progress. But within the fashion industry, experts like New York University law professor Christopher Sprigman say the ease of copying is actually good for creativity.

For instance, Khloe Kardashian stole designs from indie designer Destiney Bleu for her company Good American. Most small retailers have no recourse against huge companies and names. I'm no lawyer, but this ought to be illegal in some form. It's just wrong.","Knockoff = Parody
Counterfeit = Plagiarism",They dont lose ANY business. Most people that buy the fake stuff COULD NOT afford the real stuff anyway. Its 2 different market of consumers. ( IM NOT JUDGING! I buy my clothes at Walmart and accessories on Ebay),plot twist gucci creates knock offs just to sell more,Gucci is out. Crocs are in.,"Most people who buy the knockoffs had no intention of ever buying ""the original"" this whole argument is classist at its core. A bunch of rich people are upset that the ""peasants"" are wearing the same clothes as them. As long as the product is clearly not ""the original"", then I see no issue with it. The only reason why people buy Gucci, Prada, Tory Burch, etc is for the label. It's for the clout and the ""image"" that those labels bring. Fashion companies already have protection over their labels. What they choose to put those labels on should NOT be copyrighted unless it is a unique avant garde piece that is one of a kind or not mass produced. Many of these companies sell plain white T-shirts for 10 times the price of a simple Hanes, should they get copyright over a white t-shirt? I don't think so.",Imagine if Gucci made the first pair of pants and patent that design. What would 90% of the world be wearing now??? Skirts?,"I don't feel sympathetic for luxury brands like Gucci but knockoffs are fast fashion and use sweatshop labour, which i don't support.","*""Ah yes, i'll buy this $30 shoe and save $970, perfect""*

We might think that militaries all over the world are full of big, strong men and incredible, brave women. But not everyone's army fits into that perspective, and some aren‚Äôt even half as brave as we automatically assume. There are definitely some military troops out in the world who will go out to fight without a care in the world, and they do it because of the pride that they feel for their country. But there are other armies out there who simply don‚Äôt have the support or knowledge of how to fight with the same amount of power. Some of these troops simply don‚Äôt have the manpower to sufficiently protect their countries, and others are being let down by corruption or problems higher up the ladder. Either way, the troops in this video aren't the ones that you‚Äôll want to run to if ever you‚Äôre in need.

Read ProPublica's full feature story here:
https://features.propublica.org/ibm/ibm-age-discrimination-american-workers/ 

In a ProPublica feature that collected the stories of over 1,400 former IBM employees, it was estimated that a staggering 20,000 American employees ages 40 and over have been eliminated by the company. How does one of the country‚Äôs largest tech giants quietly push out this many older workers? Don‚Äôt we have laws to protect people at the end of their careers?

How is this legal? You're setting up a system that will always be used to ensure that powerful stakeholders will never be held accountable.,Never be loyal to any company.,Kind of weird that they would do that considering they're name is basically synonymous with old.,"An IT worker in their 40s is hardly obsolete or over-the-hill.  People of that generation are the ones who built the Internet and created most of the IT infrastructure the world uses. The reason tech companies, and companies in general, try to shadily get rid of older workers is because people in their 40s are not as easy to exploit as new graduates who know nothing about the working world. That being said, a company that does this kind of thing usually ends up shooting itself in the foot. When was the last time something truly innovative came out of IBM anyways? Companies are only as good as they treat their staff.",I wonder if there's anyone watching this with an IBM computer,"I'm 58 and I have almost always had multiple job offers, including many former employers.
Had a layoff only once for two weeks when I was young due to business turn-down.

The trick is to stay as current and knowledgeable in your field  as possible - Look for trends  in your field that may give you clues as to where it is headed.  But do not limit yourself to one field either. Be willing to work  sometimes unpleasant tasks without complaint - be flexible with work hours, assignments and tasks.   Get as much training as you possibly can, especially outside your comfort zone.  Your have to be willing to change jobs and employers often.   Don't get pigeonholed into repetitive tasks. 
 I change companies on average about every 5 years on my own initiative in order to maximize wages, because I get the highest wage increases when I move to a new employer.  Then try to save and invest   some percent of your extra income.  
Don't waste your money buying ready made meals, make your own coffee and sandwiches at home.  Don't saddle yourself with crazy amounts of debt  if possible.
Find your happiness outside work, work is to make money period ...
Think of your self as a product that the employer needs, and make sure you are the best product he can buy by continuously self-improving.
Be ready at all times for layoff!   Don't let your employer define who you are and have no fear of a layoff. 
I have purchased equipment that would help me start my own business if I had to, but I have not needed to yet so it will be re-sold upon my  ""retirement.""
Do not be loyal to the company besides giving an honest days work, especially in an environment where it won't be recognized and rewarded.    
You must look out for yourself and your family first.
(edit) And don't let yourself get too stressed out...it can lead to bad health and death and then you won't be any good to anyone...if your job stress affects your health you need to bail...","This is happening at a lot of companies across the world though. They lay off older, more experienced workers, on higher wages and then bring in these young naive over-enthusiastic workers, who do whatever they're told, for peanut wages, because they're so desperate to get their foot on the work ladder. People that have worked 30 years good service for their company, blemish free records & they're getting hauled over hot coals for minor discrepancies & given the option to either leave or be made to leave. There's no loyalty anywhere.",I'm surprised that this a surprise. This is happening across all industries and has since the 80s. The ball was all in business court and the vast majority of people have no effective redress regarding employment.,"The workforce has dramatically changed over this generation. High tech jobs are set up so that employees work on short term projects and need to apply for a new job every few years. Good luck to an older employee who hasn't stayed on the cutting edge of his field. In America where health care is linked to an employer, people would be wise to cache earnings in anticipation of needing that cushion much sooner than they may like.",Never do your employer even a small favour. They only care about their margins. Never work anywhere for more than 5 years no matter what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e681QNbHloE

Phone provided by HTC for review.",2018-06-12T20:33:06.000Z,1519003.0,42563.0,1270.0,4293,The auto-rotate dependent on grip feature is innovative.,i miss htc m8 days,"Coming back to this video after taking the risk buying one four months ago, and the U12+ has turned out excellent after some, er, ""adjustments"". They fixed the buttons and made the haptic response sharper, and it actually feels ""cool"" now with no delay. I can hand the phone to anyone, including children, and the buttons just work and they don't even ask about them. Battery life was not good out of the box, but they apparently changed something. I now leave work with the phone around 70%, and I'm a lunchtime YouTube junkie.


The dual front cameras are for more than Bokeh. The cameras are used to create a 3 dimensional depth map of your face, and it works well enough that I use it for 80% of my unlocks, and 20% for the FP reader when it's inconvenient to point the phone at my face.


The main camera is nice and fast and does very well. We are mostly an iPhone family and own the 6, 7, 8 Plus, and XS Max (my poor wallet!). The only iPhone we have that can hold a candle to the U12+ is the XS Max. The others are hopelessly outclassed, and my son who is a professional photographer gave up doing comparisons with his 8 Plus. The U12 is that good. I got a shock last night playing with the U12+ camera, and got photos that could rival Google's night sight, bit you have to use pro mode and know what you are doing.


Performance is a plus to the plus. HTC is pretty good at tuning, but I did not expect the 845 in the U12 to be faster than the 855 in the S10. Not benchmarks, but real world use. It's not a shock though, because the U11 was faster than the S9. It's not a deal breaker by any means for someone that wants the S10, but I thought it was interesting. Gaming is one area that the U12+ stands out, and I have a girl that shows up just about every day for phone gaming sessions (which is beginning to annoy my wife!), and her iPhone overheats doing the same thing that the U12 handles with ease. Three times this month she had to let the phone cool down after doing Riptide GP2 or Leo's Fortune.


Oh, forgot to mention sound! USonic earbuds. I'm a recording engineer, and I live with knowing some details and nuances in my work will probably go unnoticed by the general public. Normal headphones cannot reproduce the sound you get standing at a million dollar console in a commercial recording studio. HTC's USonic is the only thing I've heard that can come close, and it was a complete mind job for someone with my experience. The clarity, spatial imaging, crazy bass extension to frequencies that seem impossible. It will take you a week or so to get over the mind bending capabilities of USonic, and probably two weeks to get out of the habit of touching tables and walls to see if they are vibrating to the music.",From 2011 to 2014 HTC was the coolest phone manufacturer.,"back here for hTC U12+. people will love Squeeze feature when apple use it, trust me. hTC is always ahead its time. kind of sad in a economic world.",That smart rotate is a game changer.,"In my mind HTC was and still is the best, build quality, software, inovations always the best.",I just don't get why companies insist on not having a headphone jack,"Once upon a time,

Home button is weak. 
It then replaced by the virtual ones. 
The stronger, virtual home button together with the Taptic Engine and fake speaker grill, killed the headphone jack.

Then,

The screen grew larger and stronger. 
The home button gets killed by the screen. 
Taptic Engine and fake speaker grill survived. 
Headphone jack still hasn‚Äôt been revived.

Leonardo DiCaprio is considered to be Hollywood royalty. He‚Äôs been part of the acting scene for nearly thirty years now and his work is highly regarded all over the world. While he stole our hearts as a hunk in the 1997 movie ‚ÄúTitanic,‚Äù he quickly proved that he‚Äôs much more than just a pretty face. The way that he approaches his roles is fascinating and we all want to know what‚Äôs going on inside his head. And you can bet that he was paid handsomely for every acting gig over the years. These days, he‚Äôs worth about $245 million, which means he has plenty of cash to spend on luxury cars, clothing, and more. He has even used his money and efforts to help with environmental conservation too. It looks like he‚Äôs spending money on much more than just himself, and he tries to give back whenever he can. Hopefully, his efforts will make the world a better place!

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The stereotypical modern playground ‚Äî with its bright colors and rubberized flooring ‚Äî is designed to be clean, safe, and lawsuit-proof. But that isn't necessarily the best design for kids.

US playground designers spent decades figuring out how to minimize risk: reducing heights, softening surfaces, and limiting loose parts. But now, some are experimenting with creating risk. A growing body of research has found that risky outdoor play is a key part of children‚Äôs health, promoting social interactions, creativity, problem-solving, and resilience. 

Some communities are even experimenting with ‚Äúadventure playgrounds,‚Äù a format with origins in World War II Denmark, where bomb sites became impromptu playgrounds. Filled with props like nails, hammers, saws, paint, tires, and wood planks, these spaces look more like junkyards than play spaces ‚Äî and parents are often kept outside of the playground while children are chaperoned by staff. Now, that question of keeping children safe versus keeping children engaged is at the heart of a big debate in playground design.

lxuOxQzDN3Y,Robbie's Voice-Activated Room,"Robbie has duchenne muscular dystrophy, which has left him able to control only his eyes, head and right thumb joint. Among the many challenges Robbie and his family face are his bedtime routine. For years, Robbie‚Äôs mom Carrie has set her alarm every few hours to get up and change his position in bed so he doesn‚Äôt get bed sores. Earlier this year, a sleep-deprived Carrie put out a message to the Muscular Dystrophy Association asking for help to try and find a better way. She got a response from Bill Weis, a retired tech worker, who thought he could set up Robbie‚Äôs bed to be controlled by voice activation. While working on the bed, Bill had an epiphany: if he can control the bed this way, why not everything else in Robbie‚Äôs bedroom universe?",2018-10-18T18:58:34.000Z,925779.0,12903.0,1275.0,952,"Hey, Google.

If you're a gamer, then you‚Äôre definitely taking part in the Fortnite craze that has taken over the world. This video game just came out in July 2017, but it's already grown to 125 million players in only a year. While the competitive side of Fortnite is still in the preliminary stage, Epic Games announced in May 2018 that they will provide $100 million in prize money for the first year of Fortnite competition. This is good news for the talented players who are already crushing it at the game. There are some people who've capitalized on the success of Fortnite by streaming their gameplay, gaining sponsorships, and winning small-scale competitions. Not only are these players some of the most popular ones in the game, but they're also much richer than you are. If you're curious to know which Twitch streamers are bringing in a serious cash flow, check out this video on the 10 RICHEST Fortnite Players In The World.
